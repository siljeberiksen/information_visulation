Home, however, can be experienced also away from home, and ‘homeyness’ is a multidimensional concept which involves familiarity, authenticity and security of a place. Although recent research has shown the positive effect of home-like experiences on tourists’ satisfaction and loyalty, the link between homeyness and tourists’ PEBs has been substantially overlooked. Moreover, most research on tourists’ PEBs has been conducted addressing tourists’ attitudes and intentions, therefore, failing to consider possible attitude-behaviour gaps or social desirability bias. Given the relatively little research on homeyness in tourism, and its role in eliciting tourists’ PEBs, more research is needed. To fill this gap, this study explores the role of homeyness as a driver of tourists’ loyalty and PEBs, adopting tourist managers’ and operators’ perspectives. Qualitative research was conducted through in-depth interviews with a sample of 17 key stakeholders of the tourist destination of Lake Garda, Italy. The results show that familiarity, authenticity and security are key dimensions of the tourism experience provided at Lake Garda. Tourists who experience homeyness, in turn, develop destination loyalty and display higher PEBs. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","authenticity; destination loyalty; familiarity; homeyness; security; Tourists’ pro-environmental behaviours","13683500","","","2-s2.0-85175026443"

This research paper aims to examine how urban green spaces support active, healthy ageing by exploring correlations between behaviour, physical setting and gender difference among older people in a highly populated urban context. Design/methodology/approach: Urban parks in older neighbourhoods of Macau were selected for data collection. Photographic documentation was used to collect data, with 1,201 older people photographed identified as valid samples. Each was coded according to labels of behaviour, physical setting and gender. Chi-squared tests were conducted to assess correlations between behaviours and features of physical settings, and differences between genders in behaviours and physical settings. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to further examine associations between older people's behaviours and features of physical settings by gender. Findings: The research reveals types and frequency of behaviours displayed, preferred environmental features for different behaviours and gender differences in behaviours and preferred environmental features. Design principles targeting active, healthy ageing should consider particular amenities and street furniture, the arrangement of trees and landscapes and the integration of open and secluded places. Originality/value: Previous studies address older people's behaviour from the perspective of either environmental influence or gender difference, but there have been few studies on gendered behavioural differences among older people in urban green spaces.

Environmental attitudes and environmental behavioral beliefs play partial mediator roles in the relationship of vicarious experiences of nature and environmental behavior. In addition to the significant direct impact of vicarious experiences of nature on environmental behavior, indirect effects are also achieved through behavioral beliefs, environmental attitudes and the serial multiple mediation effect of the two variables.

Guided by gamified learning and self-directed informal learning theories, this study aims to examine the potential for the use of a gamified mobile app to increase students’ PEB. Also, it explores whether various pre-existing environmental attitudes and beliefs can moderate the effects. Design/methodology/approach: This quasi-experimental study proposed an eight-weeks intervention for undergraduate students based on using a mobile app. The authors evaluated the post-intervention differences in PEB between the intervention group and a control group. The effects of multiple moderators were also tested. Findings: Using the mobile app for eight weeks significantly improves the levels of PEB in the intervention group compared to the control group. None of the proposed interactions showed significant moderator effects. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first one to verify the potential moderators accounting for the success of an environmental education approach using a mobile app. Also, it provides strong empirical support for the use of such educational strategy. Based on these findings, the authors suggest the use of gamified mobile apps as suitable tools for pro-environmental education, especially when targeting young adult or student populations. Moreover, using mobile apps providing self-directed informal learning, combined with gamification, can be used to enhance other desirable behaviours. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental attitudes; Environmental education; Environmental optimism; Gamified apps; Pro-environmental behaviours","14676370","","","2-s2.0-85161570272"

In the southeastern U.S., water conservation is of particular concern because of the decades-long water war between the states of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama over two shared river basins. Individuals can only do so much to conserve water in their home, but different forms of donations can contribute to larger efforts resulting in greater environmental impact. Using a conceptual framework connecting self-identity to water conservation contribution engagement, the purpose of this study was to determine if personal water conservation behavioral intent impacted contributions to organizations supporting water conservation so effective communication strategies can be developed. Previous studies connected self-identity and intention to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, but there is a lack of research on the connection to water conservation donation behavior. Respondents were recruited to take an online survey using non-probability opt-in sampling. Self-reported intent to engage in water conservation behaviors, current contribution behaviors (if they donate to an organization that protects water, are a member of a water conservation organization, own a specialty license plate that supports water conservation, and volunteer for water conservation events), and total family income in the past year were obtained. Data were analyzed using point-biserial correlations and binary logistic regressions. The results indicated personal water conservation behavioral intent was positively correlated to water conservation contribution behaviors. Personal water conservation behavioral intent and income level were significant predictors of contribution behaviors. Environmental communicators and educators should encourage those who identify as conservationists to increase their self-identity through contributing to organizations. Future research should be conducted to determine if actual versus perceived discretionary income and/or time is a predictor of contributions. © 2023 by the authors.","climate change; conservation behavior; donation; intent to engage; self-identity; sustainability; water; water conservation","20734441","","","2-s2.0-85164818704"

Fostering pro-environmental behaviour is considered among key solutions to reduce impacts towards conservation and rehabilitation of the environment. Various stakeholders have been developing strategies to promote pro-environmental behaviour, especially from an early age that is at student level but environmental issues still prevail on the local and global agenda. Therefore, this makes it questionable about the readiness of learners to change their behaviours towards implementing pro-environmental practices. Literature shows that limited work has been undertaken to assess readiness to change towards pro-environmental behaviour. Taking cognizance of this gap, this paper investigates and analyses the readiness of students towards pro-environmental behaviour by using the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change. A survey was conducted in secondary and higher education institutions in Mauritius. Results showed that demographic factors including gender, level of education and age group had an influence on pro-environmental behaviour.

Nonetheless, there is a dearth of empirical research on this generation’s pro-environmental travel behaviour. To address this gap, the present research aims to investigate the interplay of values (egoistic, biospheric, altruistic) and ascribed responsibility in driving the pro-environmental travel behaviour of Gen Z through the moderating role of green consumption values. Data were collected from 362 British Gen Z tourists using a structured questionnaire and analysed using SmartPLS. Results revealed that values and ascribed responsibility significantly influence environmental concern, which, in turn, affects attitudes, willingness to sacrifice, and pro-environmental travel behaviour. Furthermore, positive attitudes and willingness to sacrifice significantly affect pro-environmental travel behaviour. In addition, green consumption values moderate the relationship between attitude and willingness to sacrifice concerning pro-environmental travel behaviour. Applying a generational approach, this study enriches the theoretical understanding of tourists’ pro-environmental behaviour and highlights effective ways to promote sustainable behaviour among younger travellers. © 2023 The Author(s).

While previous studies have looked at educational attainment, we focus on another dimension of cultural capital i.e., cultural engagement. Against this background, we use data from the Flemish Survey on Socio-cultural Shift to (i) examine cultural engagement and distinction in Flanders though multiple correspondence analysis and (ii) investigate the relationship between people's cultural activities and their environmental practices through structural equation modelling. Firstly, we found three modes of cultural engagement. The primary distinction resides between the culturally engaged and disengaged. The second and third respectively distinguish a traditional and folksy musical orientation from more contemporary and eclectic tastes, and highbrow culture from emerging forms of cultural capital. Secondly, our study confirms that education relates positively to environmental practices, and more importantly shows that educational differences in cultural engagement can explain educational differences in environmental practices. General cultural engagement was the best predictor of environmental practices. Highbrow cultural capital was positively associated with conspicuous forms of environmental practices (e.g., shopping). In contrast, a traditional and folksy musical orientation seemed negatively related to environmental practices. In conclusion, our findings present strong evidence for a (re)conceptualization of environmental practices as a cultural taste and a potential form of cultural capital. Our study suggests that future research on social differentiation and cultural hierarchies should pay more attention to environmental practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Culture; Environmentalism; Inequality; Social class; Stratification; Sustainability","0304422X","","","2-s2.0-85150173536"

We examined how these choices relate to different socio-demographic factors and moral foundations in a Finnish population survey sample (N = 1,020). Consistent with previous research, endorsing care and fairness foundations related positively to using plant-based food and local and natural food, as well as using sustainable energy, materials, housing and transportation solutions. However, also endorsing binding moral foundations, loyalty, authority and sanctity, related positively to using local and natural food and to using an electric car or biofuels. Most pro-environmental practices were related to being a woman, younger age and having higher education, but preferred choices differed according to living environment (urban or rural). We conclude that different pro-environmental choices are appealing to different socio-demographic groups with different moral views. Promoting different ways of contributing to ecologically sustainable future could be a way to reach different societal groups. In addition, re-framing more sustainable practices, such as plant-based diets, could contribute to such practices becoming a feasible option for more diverse groups. Individuals' preferred future lifestyles are those that align with their moral views, and therefore policymakers should embrace this (moral) diversity in the design of future policies. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","future visions; moral foundations; population survey; sustainable consumption; sustainable lifestyles","10529284","","","2-s2.0-85150382703"

Studying effective ways to design advocacy messages that can promote individuals’ intentions to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic bags in order to mitigate plastic bag pollution in the effort to help restore marine biodiversity is necessary. Utilizing emotional appeal messages, such as messages that are designed to elicit audiences’ feelings of empathy, can promote a variety of pro-environmental behaviors. To investigate an effective way to generate empathy, this online experiment study conducted with 257 college students in the U.S. examined whether messages that encourage perspective-taking can successfully elicit empathy among participants. Additionally, the study explored whether messages that encourage perspective-taking can promote viewers’ behavioral intentions to engage in the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic bags) via the mediating roles of empathy and guilt. Results indicated that perspective-taking messages can increase viewers’ empathy, which was positively associated with feelings of guilt, which in turn was positively associated with viewers’ 3Rs behavioral intentions. The study also investigated the influence of self-efficacy on guilt as well as the interaction of self-efficacy and perspective-taking on guilt. Results suggested that self-efficacy did not have an effect on guilt, and the effects of self-efficacy and perspective-taking on guilt were independent of each other.

Using a whole-life-systems’ non-exemptionalist worldview, a conceptual model is presented to help explore the theoretical possibilities for creating regenerative sustainability pathways. Learning to restore and improve the life-support conditions that ensure long-term sustainability will require enacting positive synergies between social and biophysical capitals as well as reframing anthropocentric conceptions of agency and of individual emancipation. In particular, regenerative sustainability pathways entail synergising different kinds and levels of agency in non-dualistic ways and tackle at the same time transformations in: social and institutional arrangements (S), energy and natural resources (E), information and knowledge systems (I) and accumulated environmental change (C) -the SEIC model. © 2023 The Author(s).

Taking the role of consumers into account, activities comprising purchasing decisions and political engagement are expected to help prevent plastic pollution. The goal of this study was to examine antecedents of three potential plastic reduction activities: purchasing, activism, and policy support. Based on well-established psychological models of pro-environmental behaviour (i.e. theory of planned behaviour, norm activation model), an online survey (N = 648) was administered and analysed via structural equation modelling. Results revealed that personal norms were a relevant predictor of all three intentions. Whereas sufficiency orientation and collective efficacy predicted only activism intention and policy support intention, perceived behavioural control was the strongest predictor of purchasing intentions. Regarding behaviour, people with high activism intentions and sufficiency orientation were more likely to choose a plastic-free incentive instead of the conventional shopping voucher. This study highlights psychological antecedents of plastic reduction. An integrated model showed that rational cost–benefit considerations as well as morality serve as drivers of reducing plastic consumption. Implications for the promotion of plastic-free consumption are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Environmental psychology; Plastic consumption; Pro-environmental intentions; Sufficiency orientation; TPB","1387585X","","EDSNB","2-s2.0-85126060433"

However, these objectives cannot exist only in the minds of hotel employees and managers, but should be communicated to all stakeholders, including hotel guests. Looking at the problem of environmental degradation more broadly, it is worth noting that the need to reverse the anti-ecological tendencies of world economies is becoming not so much a regional challenge as a global one. Thus, pro-ecological solutions implemented in individual hotels and even hotel chains cannot remain the exclusive domain of such establishments, but should be popularised, or at least easily accessible to other hotel chains, which, in this respect, function as coopetitors with the same goal in mind rather than competitors. The cognitive aim of this study is to identify the characteristic features of ecological awareness and to propose recommendations for pro-ecological behaviours in the form of open eco-innovations. The achievement of this objective required the execution of a research project involving 1351 hotel guests. The research was carried out using a questionnaire method in Poland's largest cities during the holiday months of 2021. The general willingness to incur additional financial burdens related to pro-ecological measures is declared by slightly more than one third of respondents. The vast majority of hotel guests choose to accept a variety of pro-ecological measures and restrictions. © 2023 The Authors","Hotels; Open eco-innovations; Pro-environmental awareness; Willingness to pay","21998531","","","2-s2.0-85160403220"

Generation Z plays a vital role in taking responsibility for environmental concerns, and without rigorous action and support measures, they will be the group most affected by climate change. Their perceptions, attitudes, and actions are crucial to the success of the energy transition. Therefore, this study aims to explore the factors influencing Generation Z’s pro-environmental behavior in order to support the energy transition in Indonesia. The combination of the extended theory of planned behavior and the pro-environmental behavior concept was used as the main framework of this study. Statistical analysis was conducted using partial least square structural equation modeling with SmartlPLS 3.0 software. Quantitative data were collected using a snowball method online questionnaire that was distributed to 400 Generation Z individuals born between 1997 and 2012, who reside in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results indicate that environmental awareness and environmental concern have a positive influence on Generation Z’s attitude towards the energy transition in Indonesia. Attitude and perceived behavioral control positively influence the intention to support the energy transition, whereas perceived behavioral control and intention contribute positively to Generation Z’s pro-environmental behavior. Conversely, the subjective norm exerts no influence on intention. Interventions aimed at enhancing Generation Z’s support for the energy transition should address factors that positively influence pro-environmental behavior. These insights can aid governments, institutions, and stakeholders in devising interventions to increase Generation Z’s engagement in the energy transition and foster the adoption of pro-environmental behavior. © 2023 by the authors.","energy transition; generation Z; pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85173043566"

In exploring the life stories of people who wanted to “heal” nature as well as those who were being “healed” by nature through the practice of green living, this paper illuminates the interconnection between self-transformation and social transformation within the green living circle. While the first form of self-transformation occurs when individuals consciously responded to green groups’ appeals to cultivating themselves for the environment, the second mode of self-transformation happens unintendedly as people developed an interest in green living. In conclusion, I argue that the spiritual-ecological practices under the umbrella of green living offered people in Hong Kong a means to introspect, re-organize, and even transform their lives during difficult life events and challenging life transition. In turn, the emotional and spiritual experience of self-transformation not only reinforced people’s faith in the power of nature, such positive experience was also key to perpetuating their interest and efforts in greening Hong Kong and the world beyond. © Loretta I.T.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), multi-group CFAs (to calculate measurement invariance), multiple linear regressions, and moderations were performed. Results showed that pro-environmental behavior and climate change hope achieved the four assessed levels of invariance across different political orientations; climate change anxiety achieved the first three levels of invariance; and climate change perception and climate change despair achieved configural invariance. Climate change anxiety, personal experience with climate change, and climate change perception (total, reality, and consequences) presented higher values for the left political orientation than for the right or the center.

This research aims to develop a better understanding of the environmental identity concept and to describe how environmental identity can vary in different contexts, namely the work and personal spheres. For this research, 12 workers of diverse fields were invited to partake in a 30 min interview in order to validate the dimensions of environmental identity stemming from scientific literature, and to identify new themes from the interviewees’ discourse. The results of the content analysis show that environmental identity is multilayered, having individual (ex: environmental consciousness, desire to connect with nature) and social (ex: group membership, social representations) components. Moreover, context is important in understanding this identity facet, as it can be more salient at work or at home. This study helps conceptualize environmental identity in a way that will eventually facilitate its quantitative measurement. This will benefit studies on the impact of environmental identity on PEBWs, therefore guiding how organizations and leaders might encourage them in alignment with workers’ environmental identity. © 2023","Environmental identity; Identity; Pro-environmental behaviors; Workplace behaviors","26666227","","","2-s2.0-85166347398"

The primary data on cultural orientation and consumption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products is collected from about 347 Indian consumers. Four consumption culture dimensions—Environmental Fatalism, Comfort-centric Outlook, Spiritual Outlook, and Techno-criticism—were derived from primary data using factor analysis. Consumption culture dimensions are shown to have a direct influence on sustainable consumption behavior and indirect influence through personal environmental stewardship. Environmental Fatalism and Comfort-centric Outlook showed negative relationship, while Spiritual Outlook had a positive relationship with Sustainable Consumption Behavior—Techno-criticism was found to be insignificant. Further analysis revealed that Personal Environmental Stewardship partially mediates the relationship between consumption culture dimensions and sustainable consumption behavior.

We find that (a) objectively identical trade-offs are evaluated substantially differently depending on the relative rather than absolute price level of comparative choices, and (b) biospheric values correlate robustly with behavior across conditions.

However, few have regarded ethical leadership as an antecedent of employee pro-environmental behavior. Based on social and role identity theories, we investigated the mechanism by which ethical leadership affects employee pro-environmental behavior through employee environmental self-identity. We also explored the moderating role of behavioral integrity in the process of employee environmental self-identity being rendered into pro-environmental behavior. We gathered data from 284 subordinate–supervisor dyads across China’s various regions and industries and utilized a regression analysis and bootstrapping test to evaluate our hypotheses, all of which were supported by the results. We found that employee environmental self-identity played a partial mediating role in the relationship between ethical leadership and employee pro-environmental behavior. When employees perceived that their leaders had a high (low) level of behavioral integrity, employee environmental self-identity was more (less) effectively transformed into pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, the indirect effect of ethical leadership on employee pro-environmental behavior is higher (lower) through environmental self-identity at the same time.

Since a person’s willingness to engage in the energy transition is strongly influenced by their social environmental identity, we argue that interventions offering students opportunities to develop this part of themselves should foster their overall willingness to do so. We argue that modern museum exhibitions on socio-scientific issues addressing visitors as individual, social or political actors, represent particularly suitable sites for such an approach. We investigated the extent to which students’ overall willingness to act pro-environmentally changed after visiting a socio-scientific exhibition on the energy transition and the extent to which students’ subsequent overall willingness to act was influenced by their prior conceptual knowledge about energy and topic-related interest. Data for the study was collected in a pre-post design, with students (N = 185) visiting the exhibition for 90 min in between. We found that students’ overall willingness to act changed significantly from prior to after their exhibition visit, and we found that students’ prior energy knowledge but not their interest impacted their willingness to act after the visit to the exhibition. Based on these findings, we discuss that providing a broad range of opportunities for identity work to students outside of the school context fosters their willingness to act on a global scale – and that modern socio-scientific museum exhibitions are thus a useful way to complement formal education.

However, EPI research has found much discrepancy between environmental objectives and actual implementation. This paper argues that analyzing EPI in the context of policy mixes with multiple objectives, multiple instruments and their calibrations helps to better understand unavoidable tensions and limitations. We develop a framework to assess EPI at these three levels of policy output, synthesizing the EPI and policy mix literatures. We further distinguish four analytical dimensions to assess calibrations: stringency, specificity, flexibility, and temporality. A case study of the national implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in Germany 2014–2022 is used to elaborate the conceptual argument. The CAP has saliently incorporated environmental objectives, while implementation, including the calibrations of most instruments within predetermined corridors, is left to member states. A systematic meta-review of 142 texts evaluating policy instruments and calibrations in the CAP 2014–2022, focusing on Germany, found that several CAP instruments link most farm income support to pro-environmental behavior. These instruments could potentially have high environmental effectiveness and efficiency. But actual policy calibrations delivered weak EPI due to low stringency and specificity, while high flexibility and temporal accommodation of farmers' needs might support EPI by increasing acceptance. Weak EPI resulted from instrument calibrations in the face of unavoidable trade-offs between competing objectives. Our results demonstrate that calibrations can significantly affect the strength of EPI adoption, and the priorities within policy mixes more generally. © 2023 The Authors.

Based on my exchanges with Latour over the years, from the time that I became his student in the late 1990s, I show how he developed his understanding of the politics of ecology through a critical engagement with early twentieth-century theories of a “politics of things,” notably the one developed by the pragmatist philosopher John Dewey. I propose that Latour, who was greatly inspired by Dewey’s book The Public and Its Problems, through his more recent work on climate change demonstrated that the ecological crisis poses a profound challenge to the pragmatist vision of material politics. This challenge led Latour to undertake a radical reconstruction of the very idea of ecological politics and envision what he calls a politics of the earth. In a second section of this essay, I articulate a related but different possibility for the reconstruction of ecological politics, one that I believe Latour saw clearly, but did not pursue. If we are to succeed in turning politics around ecology, we will need to engage much more deeply with feminist understandings of politics, which affirm materiality, embodiment, and connectedness as unavoidable political realities. This in turn enables us to appreciate the wider relevance for understanding the ecological crisis of the feminist critique of the bifurcation of politics, which Carole Pateman identifies as the underlying schema of modern democracy. I argue that it remains one of the main blocks on our ability to reenvision politics in ecological terms today. Part reflection, part criticism, and part homage, this article then argues that we should look for orientation in feminist politics of ecology, if we want to take further the work of Latour and many others for a politics of the earth. © The Author(s) 2023.","academic disciplines and traditions; engagement; environmental practices; epistemology; genders; inequality; intervention; justice; protest","01622439","","","2-s2.0-85166596538"

Based on the empirical results obtained to date, the literature does not paint a uniform picture regarding the strength of the relationship between trust and environmental awareness. Using a large-scale, representative survey conducted in Hungary in June–July 2022, the present study—based on a data analysis—provides an answer to the question of how much the trust of the individual motivates the given individual to take pro-climate action. The results of the study show that most of the respondents cannot be viewed as pro-climate actors in spite of the fact that, in the meantime, they are concerned about climate change. Most of them are mistrustful of their fellow human beings, in other words they think that protecting the climate and taking action against climate change is not particularly important for others. One of the most important conclusions that may be drawn from the analyses is that trust influences both pro-environment/pro-climate action, and the intent to act. Research results confirm the general conclusion that supporting and increasing social trust would have a beneficial effect on more effective action against environmental challenges. © 2023 by the authors.","climate change; pro-climate action; pro-climate concern; trust–behaviour relations","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85174192200"

Resource mobilization enhances knowledge of waste-sorting and raises individuals’ environmental consciousness. Power redistribution within groups activates social networks in rural communities and changes groups’ social capital to influence residents’ collective behavior.

However, reputation management in this literature is mostly reactive, whereas firms could be expected to anticipate and prevent reputation loss when faced with the threat of activism. How they would do so is not obvious, nonetheless, because firms have to consider two opposite effects: (1) a “reputational damage mitigation” effect, through which firms can pre-emptively align to what is expected from them, and (2) a “target enhancing” effect, in which self-regulation makes firms more visible and likely to be criticized. We show, theoretically and empirically, that these two effects actually co-exist and create heterogeneity in firms’ responses when they witness activist attacks in their industry. The real impact of activism on the development of more sustainable practices is thus not only greater than if we solely considered the responses of firms that suffer direct attacks, as many firms start self-regulating before being targeted, but also varies within industries. © The Author(s) 2023.","activism; corporate environmental performance; corporate reputation; private politics","14761270","","","2-s2.0-85146551986"

The process of assigning language names is not neutral, trivial or objective: it is a highly political process driven and shaped by understandings of group identity, similarity and difference. Closer attention to local perspectives on language naming offers important insights into ideologies around social and linguistic differentiation. This paper draws together accounts of diverse language naming practices from across Indigenous Australia and applies a close lens to the region of western Arnhem Land. Through an examination of three groups (speakers of Bininj Kunwok, Mawng, and Burarra), we describe the range of strategies speakers use to divide up their local language ecologies, practices for naming lects, and the role of variation in the processes of differentiation. Naming practices between these groups show interesting similarities but also striking differences. We further highlight the interplay between two key processes which characterise local language naming strategies in the region: the 'erasure' of difference, typically from the perspective of a politically more powerful group, and the intentional creation of linguistic differentiation, or ausbau.  © 2022 Jill Vaughan et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","Indigenous Australian languages; language naming; linguistic diversity; multilingualism","01678507","","","2-s2.0-85138579594"

In order to determine the conditions which, favour the development of environmental awareness, a survey was conducted of students in the fourth grade of primary school, based on data from TIMSS 2019. The criterion variable was the score on the Environmental Awareness Scale, while the predictor variables included characteristics which vary at student, class, and school levels. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated the importance of variables at the individual level: home resources, literacy and numeracy readiness for school, confidence in science, usefulness of science lessons, and parent’s perceptions of their child’s school and expected student education level. None of the considered class and school level variables were significant predictors of environmental awareness. Between-school differences were fully explained by the final, retained model, but some variance (approx. 8%) between different classes remained unexplained by the considered predictor variables.

At the same time, third-party evaluation improves transparency and exposes firms' environmental opportunistic behavior, which increases the pressure on firms to take more responsibility for environmental protection. In an analysis of a large sample of Chinese listed firms over the period 2009–2018, we find that third-party evaluation from environmental organizations has a positive impact on firms' environmental responsibility.

Successful responses to these threats will require the involvement of stakeholders in co-developing solutions. Understanding the socio-psychological characteristics of these diverse stakeholders, including their environmental attitudes and behaviors, can potentially improve management support and effectiveness across and within these groups. Past research has focused on climate impacts and adaptation efforts in commercial fisheries, but less is known about climate-related perceptions and attitudes of recreational fishers and other stakeholders such as citizen scientists. This study investigated how pro-environmental attitudes (PEAs), pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs), and climate change concerns vary among fisheries-based recreationists based on activity type (recreational fishing, fish monitoring for citizen science) and specialization level. Among stakeholders, citizen scientists (fish counters) exhibited the strongest PEBs, followed by more specialized recreational fishers. Citizen scientists also had stronger PEAs than recreational fishers and non-fisher/non-citizen scientists, but there were no significant differences in PEAs across specialization levels. Citizen scientists showed greater concern for climate change than recreational fishers and non-fisher/non-citizen scientists. However, respondents overall showed greater concern for “the environment” than for climate change. Our results suggest that both activity type and specialization level are important considerations when developing strategies to promote pro-environmental behaviors and climate concerns and that communication frames centered on healthy ecosystems may be more effective with some stakeholders than those focused solely on climate change. We discuss implications for building public support of climate engagement efforts and sustainable, climate-resilient fisheries. © 2022 by the authors.","citizen science; climate change; fishing; nature-based activities; pro-environmental attitudes; pro-environmental behaviors; sustainable fisheries","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85146011726"

This study aims to investigate the correlations between pre-service science teachers’ pro-environmental behaviors (PEB) and values toward the environment through one-time cross-sectional survey studies. Information was collected from a sample of the predetermined population at one point, followed by correlational studies designed to explore the correlations between the variables under study. The questionnaire consists of three aspects of PEB (preservation, utilization, and appreciation) and four aspects of value (biospheric, altruistic, egoistic, and hedonic). A total of 273 female pre-service science teachers enrolling in four public universities in Indonesia participated through an online questionnaire. The purposive sampling method was chosen to constitute the sample of this study. In order to analyze the data collected, de-scriptive statistics and correlation tests were utilized. According to the results, it can be concluded that pre-service science teachers held good environmental behaviors and values. The aspects of preservation and appreciation have a positive correlation, while utilization is negative. The four aspects of value are all at high levels, as is their correlation. This result indicates that female pre-service science teachers have positive behavior and value toward the environment. Moreover, the pre-service science teacher program should encourage understanding and behavior toward the environment to prepare future science lessons more aligned with the environment. © 2023 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","behavior; female; pre-service science teacher; pro-environmental behavior; value","23391286","","","2-s2.0-85165291762"

This paper augments the HDF model in that it finds sustainable travel behavior to be not just a single construct, but rather influenced separately by sociocultural, environmental and local consumption behaviors. Second, this study also examines how these differences in sustainable travel influence the traveler’s propensity to pay. The findings of this study explain that day-to-day behavior at home does explain a traveler’s propensity to pay for sustainability efforts when traveling. Those who are more altruistic are more likely to be more environmentally friendly and more likely to look for local experiences when traveling. Those who are more environmentally minded at home are also more likely to seek out cultural, environmentally friendly and local experiences when traveling.

The world, especially the global south, including Africa (Nigeria), has continued to experience multiple consequences emanating from exacerbated environmental woes. The media plays a massive role in mounting surveillance on the environment for proper environmental management. The media is also seen as the driving force behind adopting pro-environmental behavior among citizens. How the media reports and persuades citizens to be environmentally correct will determine the robustness of the environment. It, therefore, becomes pertinent to gauge how much surveillance the media – the watchdog of society - mounts on the environment. This study employed content analysis to assess how much attention and the quality of attention the media pays to environmental issues. The study utilized the media production frame to understand and explain what influences (environmental) content creation in the media. The study finds that both the quantum and quality of media attention to environmental issues are dismal. The results revealed that only 754 stories were reported by the four newspapers analyzed within the two-year study period, and of the 754 stories reported, only eight were editorials. This study argues that it takes more than the media to create awareness about environmental sustainability. This research addressed this gap by recommending a national system of innovation and adaptation of green culture - where all the environmental stakeholders – the public and private sectors, and the media would synergistically address environmental challenges through mitigation and adaptation measures that will bring about the right policies, perception, attitude, and support to the sustenance of the environment. © The Author(s) 2023.","environmental coverage; environmental issues; environmental sustainability; green culture; media","02666669","","","2-s2.0-85165575066"

Design/methodology/approach: This quantitative research sought deductive reasoning. Data gathering took place in January 2023, following a cross-sectional framework. The researcher visited various private universities in Egypt, which used effort to change the practices among students toward sustainable developments, distributing digitally administrated questionnaires to students on campus. Through convenience nonprobability sampling, 581 questionnaires were collected and statistically analyzed, using SPSS. Findings: This study shows that altruistic and biospheric value impact students’ personal beliefs toward pro-environmental behaviors; students’ personal beliefs significantly impact the norms that are present on campus; the norms found on campus impact significantly students to behave as green passengers, recyclers and utility-savers. Practical implications: Higher education institutions play a significant role in promoting the manifestations of rationality and objectivity among students about environmental challenges and sustainable development. Eco-friendly behaviors are rooted in values; thus, understanding the initial values among students is critical in developing coping strategies and social marketing initiatives that inspire the needed conservational behaviors. Originality/value: By aligning the value-belief-norm theory with two disciplines (higher education on sustainability and social marketing), this study builds upon the theory, identifying the underlying value-structures that inspire students’ necessary environmental and sustainable behaviors to improve societies for future generation rightness.

This preoccupation is beginning to overlap with ecological concerns, as healthy diets are said to largely correspond with sustainable diets. Nevertheless, this link remains rather vague and under-researched in practice. This article adopts an ‘embodied materialist’ perspective to inquire into how the health–sustainability nexus is articulated in the everyday labour of people engaging in alternative food consumption. The interviews, carried out in Milan (Italy), suggest that focusing on health might not always be straightforwardly effective for the promotion of deep and systemic changes. The analysis finds three ways in which the health–sustainability nexus is articulated in daily life. If framed within the dominant articulation of labour and value, health is an individualistic preoccupation with limited potential for socio-ecological transformation. When food labour is guided by the very different logic of care, which emphasises relationality, fragility and the search for a shared wellbeing, more ecological practices emerge, but with some ambivalent implications especially with regards to social justice. Collective engagement in alternative food networks politicises the body more deeply, making it a concrete site of struggle against unsustainable food regimes. © The Author(s) 2023.","alimentation; alimentos; Ecology; ecología; embodied materialism; everyday life; food; health; materialismo encarnado; matérialisme incarné; salud; santé; vida cotidiana; vie quotidienne; écologie","00113921","","","2-s2.0-85175553628"

This transtemporal sense of ethical becoming reflects how the possibility of future ‘rebirth’ and accountability for past actions can motivate new ecological consciousness in the present. We forge these ideas through an empirical focus on popular Buddhist ecological practices in Singapore, where green recovery visions have primarily been driven by a secular and technocratic ethos. In negotiating the prevailing modernist ecological discourses, many Buddhists tap into an alternative imagining of cosmological time that regards Earth not simply as a place to be left behind at the end of one's life, but a permanent home for all future beings. This reading of human–ecology relations emphasises a causal responsibility to secure planetary well-being, moving the making of cosmopolitan sensibilities from the realm of beneficence into justice. Yet, this renewed cosmopolitan sensibility to Earth is not simply a prescriptive ethical framework articulated on an abstract level, but materially performed and negotiated at the level of everyday life. Recycling becomes a site of rapprochement that allows Buddhists in Singapore to promote and negotiate their ecological consciousness within the strictures of the secular state. In doing so, it opens up new spaces of postcapitalist possibility that enable Buddhists, alongside people of other or no faith, to imagine alternative ways of inhabiting the planet. By developing an alternative account of cosmopolitanism grounded in Buddhist cosmology, we identify Buddhism as a decolonial lens through which we can critically reimagine human–ecology relations, and illuminate diverse modes and practices of ethical becoming in this age of ecological crisis.

Research finds that there is an eco-gender gap in everyday environmental behaviours, with women more active than men. However, studies of the eco-gender gap have infrequently looked at other forms of pro-environmental political behaviours and focused mostly on young people. We contribute to the literature by examining to what extent older women and men differ in a range of pro-environmental political behaviours, using a unique dataset based on a survey of individuals 64 years and older. We find strong evidence of a gender gap in everyday behaviours and political consumerism, but not in relation to contentious forms of political participation.

Feminist economists have long identified that unpaid care work forms the basis for social reproduction or the unseen work through which capitalist economies and societies are reproduced. Even if the act of care is central to relationships and fundamental to our survival and wellbeing, it is too often taken for granted, invisible, not counted as productive or profitable, and carried out mostly by women, people of colour, immigrants, or other marginalised groups. This article reviews some current feminist economic thinking and practice that call for paying greater attention to ethics and practice of care as a way to build economies based on social justice, environmental sustainability, and collective well-being. It shows how this vision of better welfare, healthcare, care for children and the elderly, education and housing by neighbourhood networks and sustainable ecological practices is necessary for greater economic wellbeing and equity. © 2023 The Author(s).

The available scientific evidence shows knowledge gaps and opportunities about the role that environmental identity, connectedness with nature, and well-being play in pro-environmental behavior. To provide evidence in this regard, this research aimed to describe and identify possible significant differences between these variables to establish whether they predict pro-environmental behavior, considering the rural-urban provenance. The methodology was cross-sectional, with descriptive and correlational analysis. The sample was 1705 people (M age = 31.36 years, 57.4% female) belonging to two departments in southern Colombia (66.7% from the rural sector), and questionnaires were applied to collect the information. The results show that people of rural origin showed higher levels of environmental identity with significant differences (p-value > 0.01) compared to the urban sample. The indicators of psychological health, connectedness with nature, and identity better explain the levels of pro-environmental behavior of the urban population (R = 0.81, p-value < 0.01) compared to the rural population (R = 0.64, p-value < 0.01). This study concludes that the variables predict pro-environmental behavior, providing better explanatory evidence in urban than rural inhabitants.

The developed concept of expulsion assumes the systemic reproduction of the periphery within nation-states and is characterised by the low potential of local communities to influence the formation of development strategies in a region characterised by rich natural resources, as well as limited opportunities for its inhabitants to engage in meaningful activities and manage their personal life situations in a harsh climate and expensive living conditions. It is argued that modern practices of nature management represent consumer and quasi-traditional strategies of development of the North. They do not contribute to the formation of sustainable strategies for the development of territories, despite the growing critical attitude of the region's residents to the current situation and awareness of the deprivation of their right to own and dispose of land and natural resources. Expulsion is the result of the institutionalisation of prolonged and multiple practices of social exclusion. Institutionalisation is triggered by environmental management policies that ignore the interests of indigenous people and, as a consequence, make it difficult to defend the common interest of Northerners. It is characterised by an awareness of the injustice of this situation, reinforced by individual defence strategies and supported by five mechanisms: the mythologisation of the well-being of the North, the exploitative way of developing natural resources, the transfer of the costs of their extraction to the inhabitants of the region, the neglect of the interests of local communities, the promotion of migratory attitudes and the identity of temporary workers. The rule of access to benefits through the workplace, which has been preserved since late Soviet times, is not coping with the new challenges. As a result, resources are extracted in some regions and profits are channelled to other, usually more developed, regions. In the northern regions, where natural resources are extracted in this way, different types of dependencies are formed and impoverishment occurs. © 2023 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

However, others warn that these pro-environmental changes may have only been temporary and that negative effects could outweigh the positive ones. In this paper, we examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced pro-environmental changes in the lifestyle and consumer habits of students in Croatia. The research was conducted between the end of 2020 and the start of 2021, using an online survey method, with a convenience sampling of N=1245 students from three Croatian Universities in Osijek, Split, and Zagreb. We looked at a range of lifestyle and consumer habits, such as mobility, shopping frequency and extent, food self-provisioning, as well as recycling and household savings, to see whether there were significant changes that can be classified as environmentally friendly. The results show that the pandemic did not have a significant long-term effect on pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Those who practiced PEB before the pandemic continued to do so, primarily motivated by environmental worldview and prioritizing environmental protection. For others, there were either no changes in PEB during the pandemic, or it was only short-term, connected to the limiting circumstances of the pandemic on their usual lifestyle. © 2023, Sociological Association of Serbia.

CCRP is experiencing a renaissance with an increased focus on environmentally relevant behaviors to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, CCRP lacks investigation from the employee perspective. Supported by the social exchange and value–belief–norm theories, this study aims to address the impact of employees’ CCRP on their proenvironmental behavior (PEB) via the moderating roles of environmental values and psychological contract breach. Design/methodology/approach: The nonprobability convenience sampling technique was used to collect survey data from a sample of 299 employees across 138 manufacturing firms in Pakistan. Findings: The results show that employees’ CCRP positively impacts their PEB and that this relationship is moderated by their environmental values and psychological contract breach. Specifically, environmental values strengthen the CCRP–PEB relationship, while psychological contract breach weakens it. Practical implications: The findings of the study emphasize useful guidance for managers and practitioners as a future avenue to restructure the climate change framework by emphasizing the conditions (i.e. environmental values and psychological contract breach). In doing so, the study is beneficial for managers and practitioners in helping to increase employees’ PEB through the development of climate change action plans. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first investigations into CCRP–employees’ PEB nexus in the developing country context. The study incorporates social exchange and value–belief–norm theory, which serve as the CCRP’s theoretical underpinnings. The findings advance the new knowledge about a firm’s social responsibility to achieve the sustainable development goals outlined in the UN’s 2030 Agenda. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change risk perception; Environmental values; Proenvironmental behavior; Psychological contract breach","17471117","","","2-s2.0-85167430568"

However, humans have not slowed down their pace of resource depletion and environmental destruction. This research takes a particular path to understanding environmental consumption- through a focus on temporal perspective. Evidence from six studies demonstrates the positive effect of a cyclical temporal perspective, versus a linear temporal perspective, on consumers' pro-environmental behavior. The research shows that individuals with a cyclical perspective are more likely to include the environment in the self, which leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions and more pro-environmental behavior. This temporal perspective effect is attenuated for consumers already high on green values. The authors also examine a marketercontrolled moderator and show that consumers are more likely to purchase a pro-environmental product when they see a temporal-perspective-congruent promotional appeal. The research contributes to both the time perception and the environmental consumption literature and offers several practical implications for organizations to promote sustainable consumer behavior.  © The Author(s) 2023.","cyclical time; green values; linear time; pro-environmental behavior; temporal perspective","00935301","","","2-s2.0-85178364143"

Its reforms continue to this day and have produced robust water-management policies. This article reveals the different positions, the power structures involved, and the result of the disputes and agreements concerning the social construction of legitimate environmental behaviour in jeans manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach: Comparative case study. Data collection for this research started in 2017 and ended in 2020. The data were gathered by concentrating on a few cases in two clusters. The author visited public agencies, trade associations, and firms of all sizes and levels of specialization in the industry and conducted semi-structured interviews with them. The intention was to acquire systemic and deep knowledge of the local industry. Findings: The article's findings demonstrate a divergence in typologies that reflects the ecological limits in the use of natural resources, law-enforcement policies, and firms' legal status. The article extends our understanding of the ability of organizations to respond to institutional pressures to become sustainable. This study's findings provide insights for policy design in times of increasingly catastrophic pollution in regions that are immersed in global competition. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses only on two industrial textile clusters in Brazil, which may not be representative of the wider industry in the country or in other regions. The findings may not be generalizable to other industries or locations with different ecological limits, legal frameworks, and firm structures. Practical implications: The article's practical implications include the need for tailored regulatory frameworks, effective law enforcement policies, promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among businesses, and collaboration among stakeholders in promoting sustainability. Policymakers, regulators, and businesses in industrial textile clusters in Brazil and other regions facing similar ecological and regulatory challenges can use these insights to develop more effective policies and practices that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. Social implications: State actors emerge as the most important stakeholder group in forging the upgrading of water-management systems and technology. The optimal solution to the problem is cross-institutional and multilevel collaboration and coalitions between the different authorities and organizations involved who need to pay due attention to the relevant ecological limits and social needs. Only when this multilevel collaboration is achieved and maintained will the state's agents be able to collaborate with industrial actors and society at large. Originality/value: The article examines the various factors that influence water usage and analyses the dynamics of change in two distinct locations in an emerging market. It demonstrates that, despite the existence of the same regulatory framework in both locations, different outcomes can arise due to the construction of diverse coalitions between social actors.

While maintaining a positive relationship with nature is thought to promote personal and collective wellbeing, children and young people are spending less time outdoors, exhibiting a lack of appreciation for the environment and degrees of ‘plant blindness’. As such, there is a pressing need on behalf of schools to address these issues, and to adapt to students’ needs for a deeper and more purposeful connection with nature. This study aimed to explore the potential of one avenue to achieving this: arts-in-nature practice. This involved utilising arts-based research methods, through which 97 children aged 7–10 drew their ‘happy place’, alongside participatory observations, and interviews and focus groups with artists and teachers, as part of the wider Eco-Capabilities project. Findings suggest that following the arts-in-nature sessions there was a significant increase in the number of children’s drawings which featured nature as a main focus. This was achieved in three ways: by drawing newfound attention to nature; by attributing increased value to nature; and by explicitly placing nature within the purview of wellbeing. As such, we argue that creative pedagogies outdoors likely enhance what we term ‘nature visibilisation’ in children, an outcome necessary for their personal wellbeing and sustainability of the environment. This has significant implications for school practice in relation to how to support children’s mental health and wellbeing, alongside boosting interest in environmental sustainability and pro-environmental behaviour. © 2023 by the authors.","arts; eco-capabilities; environmental sustainability education; nature; nature visibilisation; plant blindness; wellbeing","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85169079714"

Still, the influence of experiencing extreme weather events on actual behaviour has rarely been tested with large-scale individual-level data and longitudinal methods. This study links panel data from 35,678 individuals to floods across England and heatwaves across the UK and applies within-person estimators to account for pre-existing differences between affected and unaffected individuals. Results reveal that individuals are more likely to believe in climate change after being affected by a geographically proximate flood or a temporally proximate heatwave. This association is stronger among initially right-leaning partisans and those initially more sceptic about the existence of climate change, thereby indicating attitudinal updating due to experiential learning. However, those exposed to extreme weather events do not change their environmental behaviour such as energy saving, sustainable shopping or mode of transportation. Even among those who are more likely to believe in climate change, people’s behaviour does not react to extreme weather events. © 2023 The Author(s).

Reviewing the existing literature, we describe how religious stewardship belief may shape cognitions and emotions regarding various environmentally relevant objects (i.e., natural environment, environmental problems, and pro-environmental behaviors) and how these cognitions and emotions lead to motivation to engage in pro-environmental action. We also discuss religious beliefs that may suppress the positive effects of stewardship belief as well as key factors that may moderate the effects of stewardship belief. Last, we discuss potential ways of leveraging religious stewardship in messaging and communications for behavioral change toward sustainability. Although the existing evidence on whether religion helps or hinders environmental protection is mixed, our review suggests that stewardship belief clearly provides great potential for environmental support among religious communities. © 2023 Cognitive Science Society LLC.","Emotion; Pro-environmental behavior; Religion; Stewardship; Sustainability","17568757","","","2-s2.0-85147997284"

The model was built and tested using survey data collected from approximately 2300 individuals living inside or near six Protected Areas in five different European countries using both face-to-face and online methods. Results show that perceived social impacts are a key and consistent predictor of the level of stated support, despite the wide range of potential impacts. Also important is the strength of a person's sense of place attachment to the PA landscapes or area, as well as institutional trust. Other factors were only significant at some sites indicating the importance of local context. Results indicated that stated support is linked with pro-environmental behaviour when using the protected area, indicating the importance of supportive public attitudes for behaviour that is supportive of ecological effectiveness. The link between stated support and volunteering was less clear indicating that this is also influenced by other factors. The model is intended to inform theoretical understanding of the factors affecting public support, but also as a step towards developing a predictive tool for practitioners taking into consideration a broader range of factors in assessing public support and highlighting problem areas for action. As new ambitious biodiversity conservation targets are set internationally, our study will be useful for practitioners and researchers regarding what future management approaches and policies need to focus on in order to maximise public support, minimize conflicts in PAs and increase pro-environmental behaviour. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; EU Biodiversity strategy; Natural resource management; Protected area management; Public participation","14629011","","ESCPF","2-s2.0-85153045426"

The accelerated glacial recession worldwide calls for carbon reduction and sustainable glacier conservation and management. To this end, simply prohibiting tourists from visiting may not be as effective, comparing to engaging them through innovative means to promote pro-environmental behavior. This paper examined factors that influence tourists’ low-carbon behavior while on-site and after their visits to glaciers through two studies (Study 1–on-site visitor survey; Study 2–a scenario experiment using glacier virtual reality games). Results showed that tourist engagement positively influenced their low-carbon behavior, but was mediated by the sequential influence of place attachment and environmental responsibility. The perceived threat of glacier shrinkage moderated this relationship. Results also provide practical implications for sustainable tourism management at glacier destinations and beyond. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Glacier tourism; place attachment; pro-environmental behavior; tourist engagement; virtual reality","09669582","","","2-s2.0-85178220277"

Considering its scale and magnitude, questions about the impact of this newly emerging climate movement arise. This article is based on a survey investigating the perception of Swiss residents (N = 1206) of how the FFF movement and Greta Thunberg’s climate activism changed their environmental awareness and behaviour. We found that the Swiss public by and large perceives Greta Thunberg and the FFF movement positively, and a considerable share of participants report that Greta Thunberg (30%) and the FFF activism (23%), respectively, positively influenced their environmental concern and behaviour. Structural equation modelling revealed that the strength of the behaviour change motivation depended mainly on how a participant evaluated the FFF movement and Greta Thunberg. The latter was influenced positively by general environmental attitudes, and education level and negatively by the acceptance of justifications for environmentally harmful behaviours. Participants reported environmentally positive changes most frequently in private sphere behaviours, particularly in the domains of mobility, consumption and waste, whereas few changes in public sphere behaviour were reported. Next to increased awareness and motivation gains, also the reinforcement of existing pro-environmental behaviour was reported. Although the influence on sympathisers was stronger, some of those sceptical of the climate strike movement also reported behaviour changes, indicating that the unconvinced have to some extent been reached. © 2023, The Author(s).","Climate action; Collective action; Environmental attitudes; Pro-environmental behaviour; Social movements; Sustainability transitions","18624065","","","2-s2.0-85163729156"

Can religions excite pro-environmental actions? Chinese religion encompasses Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, native Taoism, and indigenous folk beliefs (GuanDi and Mazu). We theorize that believers demonstrate more sustainable HOPE (Help Ourselves Protect the Environment) than non-believers. Religions with standardized and formal liturgy show more pro-environmental HOPE than those without it. We challenge the myth that the believers of Christianity and Islam display more sustainable HOPE than other faith. The 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (involving 10,017 randomly selected participants across 28 provinces) revealed that 11.10% of them have faith. Believers display higher levels of HOPE than atheists, demonstrating the religion effect. Among believers, native Taoism and Buddhism exhibit more ecological HOPE than other religions, supporting the dogma effect in the Chinese culture. Religions with formalized liturgy demonstrate more pro-environmental HOPE than generalized folk beliefs—GuanDi and Mazu, validating the liturgy effect. Females, married, and people with good income, education, health, and country-domicile—the haves—exhibit robust ecological HOPE. The rich get richer and greener.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying restrictive measures also transformed forests into some of the few places to spend time away from home. The presented study drew on the assumption that the pandemic situation and a rise in the number of forest visits would affect the experience, recognition, and appreciation of the well-being aspects related to spending time in forests. The study goal was to elucidate the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationships between forest visits, well-being and stress relief, emotions, perception of nature and forest value and importance, pro-environmental behavior, and societal expectations of the role of forests and forest ecosystem services. A survey using a digital questionnaire was conducted several months after the pandemic outbreak on a representative sample of the Slovak population. The Wilcoxon test and ordinal regression analysis were used to identify significant relationships, e.g., between the recency of anger episodes and the number of forest visits. The results showed that the pandemic strengthened the perception of forests as a high-quality restorative environment and that emotions associated with forest visits played an important role in the perceived importance of forests and their possible overexploitation. The results underscore the urgent need to put demands for forest recreation on par with the forest bioeconomy and to sensitize forest visitors to management and conservation requirements. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Forest exploitation; Forests; Ordinal regression; Restorative environment; Stress relief; Subjective well-being","00447447","","AMBOC","2-s2.0-85145863100"

Self-reported PEB measures in surveys often contain non-negligible measurement error that can bias estimates and lead to incorrect findings. Given the potential presence of error, we hypothesize that changes to the way self-reported PEB is measured might lead to systematic measurement errors that affect the validity of results. Study 1 (N = 951) showed that priming participants with related scales like environmentalist identity did not substantively change reported behavior (all ds ≤ 0.12). To investigate the possibility of overreporting without priming, Study 2 (N = 385) measured littering prevention behavior using the Unmatched Count Technique. A standard questionnaire format led to much higher reported behavior compared to the more anonymous covert condition, d = 0.53, and this effect appeared driven by participants who reported a stronger environmentalist identity. These results may help to explain some of the observed error in PEB measures. We suggest that researchers could reduce measurement bias with indirect questioning techniques. © 2023 The Author(s)","Measurement error; Pro-environmental behavior; Question-behavior effect; Social desirability bias; Social identity; Social norms","26666227","","","2-s2.0-85148554169"

Recognizing that environmental issues stem largely from human behavior, the study explores how perspectives derived from the holy book influence individuals. Employing moral theory and liberation theology, the research adopts a qualitative and ethnographic approach to reveal the impact of theology-based Al-Quran learning on environmental practices at pesantren. The findings illustrate that eco-theology-based learning has sparked a notable environmental transformation, shielding the community from ecological crises. This transformation unfolds through a multifaceted process: communal dialogues addressing local challenges, rigorous study of the Quran under the guidance of kyai (Islamic scholars), and subsequent environmental conservation initiatives spearheaded by pesantren. The amalgamation of religious teachings with practical actions has not only mitigated environmental crises but has also alleviated social challenges. BUAP serves as a catalyst for positive change and demonstrates the potential of Qur'anic learning to inspire environmentally conscious behavior. This research contributes to understanding the role of Islamic education in fostering eco-conscious attitudes and offers insights into the synergy between religious teachings and environmental stewardship for the betterment of society. © 2023, Faculty of Tarbiya and Teacher Training UIN Sunan Gunung.

In this paper, we advance theory on SOP in working landscapes by assessing the relationship between several new and modified sense of place measures and farmer adoption of cover crops in Iowa. We used data from a 2018 survey of Iowa farmers and a Bayesian logistic regression, finding that physical dependence and economic dependence are distinct dimensions of SOP in working landscapes and the addition of a measure beyond SOP of who farmers feel responsible to when making land management decisions provides insights on how social groups are influential in farmers’ decision-making. Our results suggest the SOP conceptual framework has the potential to help explain conservation behavior in working landscapes, and identifies opportunities for further reconceptualization and testing. © 2023 The Author(s).

Despite the wealth of knowledge published in academic journals, there is a need to understand the order and content of this discourse, including the employed theoretical approaches and empirical evidence. Methods: A combination of systematic literature review and quantitative content analysis methods was employed. Articles for analysis were identified through Web of Science and SCOPUS, followed by a detailed analysis of 200 papers from the journal Environment and Behavior. The study aimed to explore the historical stages, theoretical diversity, and the empirical evidence brought forward in the academic discourse on environmental attitudes and behaviors. Results: The findings reveal distinct historical stages within the academic field of environmental attitudes and behaviors. There is a notable growth in theoretical diversity and intensity of the discourse, particularly after 2000. The dominance of socio-psychological explanatory models is evident. Furthermore, the empirical evidence base is geographically limited, mostly coming from the US. Discussion: The study discusses the limitations of the academic discourse on environmental attitudes and behaviors and provides guidelines for future research. It emphasizes the need to address the identified shortcomings, such as expanding theoretical perspectives and increasing the geographical diversity of empirical evidence. The study's findings contribute to understanding the development and characteristics of the academic field, while also identifying avenues for further exploration.

This paper investigates 626 residents neighboring the Yongding River Watershed through a face-to-face questionnaire survey to reveal public perceptions, attitudes, concerns, and behaviors toward sustainable watershed protection and proposes multiple regression models to explore factors affecting their concerns and behaviors. The results show that the majority of respondents (52–58%) have limited knowledge about the watershed environment, and their views are influenced by living places. More than half of the respondents (52%) believe that upstream should take responsibility for watershed protection, but 72% are not aware that upstream suffers economic restrictions. Public behaviors toward watershed protection are diverse depending on knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about the watershed environment as well as on sociodemographic background. Our results highlight that a better understanding of watershed protection can be used to foster public participation and increase support for watershed management initiatives. © 2023 by the authors.","pro-environmental behaviors; public attitudes; public perceptions; sustainable watershed protection","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85152649439"

Sampling 25 rural towns in Utah, USA. with homogenous religious identities and political affiliations, we replicate past regression analyses from similar studies. We conclude that although our results are generally consistent with the literature, unlike what the replicated studies suggest, religious identity is not a consistent predictor of EA.

Action competence for sustainability is suggested covering the essential components of youth’s readiness to act both individually and collectively, but empirical tests of these associations are scarce. Therefore, this study explores the relationship between action competence and sustainability action among young people. We conducted a national survey of 15 to 29-year-old youths (N = 940) in Finland. Results of structural equation modeling show that self-perceived action competence for sustainability predicts private sphere behavior, but not sustainability action. Further analysis on the components of action competence reveals that high perceived knowledge and low outcome expectations predict low engagement in sustainability action. Knowledge and outcome expectations also affect behavior indirectly via willingness to act. We argue that actions and behaviors have different antecedents, and that the ability to recognize outcome uncertainty affects how young people’s sustainability agency is manifested. © 2023 The Author(s).

Behaviors that primarily benefit other people are prosocial behaviors that can be considered solidarity at the collective level. For climate-change mitigation, greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced primarily in wealthy countries, while the major beneficiaries of such a reduction are the populations of developing countries and future generations, who (will) suffer the significant negative consequences of climate change. Climate change has created a new global interdependence that requires a new form of solidarity as a global and intergenerational prosocial behavior. Low-carbon behavior has so far mainly been studied as a form of pro-environmental behavior but not as a form of prosocial behavior. The article identifies four approaches to explaining the origin of prosocial behavior that can be applied to the emergence of low-carbon behavior: rationalist, institutionalist, interactionist, and situational approaches. The scope conditions and limitations of each approach in the case of low-carbon behavior are discussed, together with relevant empirical evidence, future research directions, and policy implications.

We further theorize that the role of CEO environmental awareness is contingent on environmental institutional pressure. To validate the model, we collected survey data from 534 senior executives of 178 manufacturing firms in China. The main results show that corporate environmental practice completely mediates the relationship between CEO environmental awareness and NPD performance. The relationship is positively moderated by environmental normative pressure, whereas environmental regulatory pressure negatively moderates this process.

However, the impact of company ownership on environmental performance remains unclear. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationship between company ownership and company interest in measuring the environmental impact of its supply chains, as the environmental aspect is directly linked to supply chain activities and has quantifiable measures. Using random effects ordered logistic regression on panel data from 2017 to 2022 for 2811 companies, we show that companies with long-term investment sources demonstrate a greater interest in measuring environmental variables in their supply chain compared to those financed with short-term investments. Sovereign wealth funds and other long-term investment sources exhibit a positive and significant correlation with higher utilization of ESG indicators in the supply chain. These findings suggest that policymakers and private companies aiming to enhance sustainability should prioritize longer-term investment sources, which display stronger commitments to sustainability and ESG practices and are more likely to use environmental initiatives in their supply chains. © 2023 by the authors.","corporate social responsibility; environmental supply chain management; ESG; financial performance; green supply chain; ownership; principles for responsible investment; sustainability","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85168798073"

We use representative panel data on renewable energy usage from a total of five panel waves collected in Germany during the years 2015 to 2019 to show that neutralizations moderate the effects of both environmental concerns and normative expectations of families and peers. For individuals who have learned neutralization techniques, neither environmental concerns nor normative expectations play a role as determinants of renewable energy usage.

Research participants were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions defined by recreation type (appreciative vs. mechanized), recreation activity (birdwatching, nature photography, motorcycling, and motor boating) nested within recreation type, and interpretation (interpretation provided vs. not provided). We measured three dimensions of environmental concern: specific environmental concern (SEC), worldwide environmental concern (WEC), and general environmental behavior (GEB). Appreciative activity participants and participants who received interpretation had significantly higher SEC scores than those who participated in mechanized activities and those who did not receive interpretation. Interpretation experiences elevated WEC and GEB, with the effect being more substantial among participants who participated in mechanized recreation activities. Appropriate cautions are advised against making management decisions based on results of individual studies, but within that context, we suggest the following: • Interpretation programs designed using Tilden’s (1957) classic principles of interpretation can be effective in elevating environmental concern. • Interpretation programs may be more effective if conducted as part of appreciative recreation experiences (e.g., hiking, birdwatching, nature photography). • For WEC and GEB, interpretation may mitigate detrimental effects of participation in mechanized forms of recreation (motor boating, motorcycling). • This study represents the first of its kind to document the proposed effects on environmental concern using experimental methods. © 2023, Sagamore Publishing LLC.

Analysis: Correlations and nonlinear canonical correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. The coefficients of canonical and multiple correlations were calculated. Results: Nature visits were associated with involvement in environmental volunteering (V =.317, P ≤.05) among men. In these, higher levels of moderate-vigorous PA were associated with green travel behavior (η2 =.325, P ≤.05). Connectedness with nature was related (P ≤.05) to private sphere behaviors, such as purchase of eco-products (η2 =.191) and local/seasonal products (η2 =.186) in females and encouraging care and protection of natural environment (η2 =.336, P ≤.01) in males. Conclusions: Nature visits, connection to nature, and physical activity levels were related to the adoption of PEBs in the private and public sphere, and these relationships differed between men and women. © The Author(s) 2022.","accelerometer; emotional connectedness to nature; environmental health; gender differences; health policies; sustainable behaviors; visits to natural environments","08901171","","AJHPE","2-s2.0-85135802561"

The media offers an alternative explanatory pathway to understanding citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental governance, but the existing literature still lacks empirical studies on this topic and the intermediate mechanisms. Adopting an environmental communication perspective, this paper divided the environmental effects of media into two dimensions: knowledge growth and responsibility cultivation, and conducted an empirical analysis on whether, and how, media use affected citizens’ WTP, based on data from the China General Social Survey 2018 (hereafter, CGSS2018). The findings found that the frequency of media use significantly increased citizen’s WTP, in which individual environmental responsibility rather than environmental knowledge played a mediating effect; i.e., media use increased individuals’ WTP by increasing the public’s environmental responsibility. Furthermore, this study discovered that traditional media use had a significant effect on the citizens’ WTP, again verifying the mediating effect of individual environmental responsibility, while new media use did not have such a communication effect. This study extends the theories related to pro-environmental behaviors, and provides practical implications for the government to promote environmental governance and sustainability. © 2022 by the author.","environmental knowledge; environmental responsibility; media use; new media; traditional media; willingness to pay (WTP)","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85148103163"

These embodied interactions can bridge nature and culture, and inform interventions for more sustainable ecosystems. Conceptual methods were used to explain the sport-nature-culture nexus and postulate an interdisciplinary framework of social sport ecology, incorporating management, nature sports, neo-tribalism, and non-representation theoretical perspectives. The proposed framework suggests that multi-sensory stimuli, embodied sport practices and neo-tribal cultural values shape the “sports ecosphere,” which needs to be attuned with the affective/cognitive dimensions of experience in ways that build caring cultures for the environment. The significance of this work lies in its comprehensive perspective to the environmental management of outdoor sports by demonstrating the critical role of politics, culture, experience and movement in contemporary sport. It suggests a holistic approach of social sport ecology to better understand and reimagine the environmental practices and character of outdoor sports.

This study addresses that gap by focusing on socio-political and demographic factors shaping support for carbon regime destabilization policies in one of the most carbon-intensive regions of Europe. Carbon-intensive industries, especially coal mining and coal-based power generation, are often concentrated in a few carbon-intensive regions. Therefore, decarbonization actions will affect those regions particularly strongly. Correspondingly, carbon-intensive regions often exert significant political influence on the two climate mitigation policies at the national level. Focusing on Poland, we investigate socio-political and demographic factors that correlate with the approval or rejection of the two climate mitigation policies: increasing taxes on fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal and using public money to subsidize renewable energy such as wind and solar power in Poland and its carbon-intensive Silesia region. Using logistic regression with individual-level data derived from the 2016 European Social Survey (ESS) and the 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we find party-political ideology to be an important predictor at the national level but much less so at the regional level. Specifically, voting for right-wing party is not a divisive factor for individual support of the two climate mitigation policies either nationally or regionally. More interestingly, populism is a strong factor in support of increasing taxes on fossil fuel in the carbon-intensive Silesia region but is less important concerning in support of using public money to subsidize renewable energy in Poland overall. These results show the heterogeneity of right-wing party and populism within the support for the two climate mitigation policies. Socio-demographic factors, especially age, gender, education level, employment status, and employment sector, have even more complex and heterogeneous components in support of the two climate mitigation policies at the national and regional levels. Identifying the complex socio-political and demographic factors of climate mitigation policies across different national versus carbon-intensive regional contexts is an essential step for generating in situ decarbonization strategies. © 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Climate mitigation policies; Decarbonization actions; Poland; Right-wing party populism; Silesia","20970129","","","2-s2.0-85142458078"

To ensure rapid, widespread and equitable adaptation to these risks, government policy must be enacted to support community-wide adaptation. Public support for adaptation policy will be key to its passage. To date, few studies have focused on what factors motivate public support for adaptation policy, especially at the subnational level. To address these gaps, we develop a conceptual model that draws on and synthesizes past conceptual frameworks and literature related to environmental behavior and adaptation specifically. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examine this model, drawing on data from a statewide survey of over 2700 individuals from the state of Indiana in the Midwestern United States. We assess the drivers of two distinct measures of policy support: support for climate adaptation policy and support for climate adaptation taxes. We find that threat appraisal, climate risk perception, perceived efficacy of government, respondent's climate change beliefs, perceived descriptive and dynamic norms around policy support, and social structural characteristics such as political affiliation are important drivers of support for adaptation policy, but that their effects differ across our two outcome measures. These findings point to opportunities to better engage the public in policy discourse, while also suggesting that distinct motivations shape support for policy compared to the taxes likely needed to support these new programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Policy; Public opinion; Quantitative methods","09593780","","GECHE","2-s2.0-85120472860"

The utilization of social media has the potential to augment the dissemination of environmentally conscious messages while simultaneously perpetuating the culture of consumption that is a driving force behind environmental degradation. This study investigates the impact of social media on the pro-environmental conduct of university students within the educational framework of ChengDu, China. A cross-sectional approach was employed to collect data from 287 university students through self-reported measures. The assessment of pro-environmental conduct was conducted across three distinct sub-categories, namely household, information, and transportation. The findings indicate that social media usage positively impacts pro-environmental behavior among college students, with pro-environmental attitudes serving as a partial mediator of this relationship. The research findings indicate a correlation between the utilization of social media and pro-environmental conduct. Additionally, it was observed that this correlation is influenced by the level of environmental consciousness, as a more pronounced positive association was observed among students who exhibit heightened environmental awareness. The findings contribute to the existing literature on the relationship between social media and pro-environmental behavior by elucidating the intermediary and regulatory impacts of pro-environmental attitudes and environmental consciousness. The current study's results have both theoretical and practical implications, as well as the potential to leverage social media to promote environmentally conscious actions among college students. The study suggests potential avenues for future research, such as using longitudinal or experimental methodologies and replicating findings in diverse educational contexts. © 2022 Ani Publishing Ltd.

While socioeconomic, technological and institutional lock-ins have been widely used to understand processes of sustainable transitions in agri-food systems, the role of so-called cognitive lock-ins is still under-investigated. In this study, we focus on how institutional settings create cognitive lock-ins in farmers’ decision-making related to the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. We apply goal framing for environmental behaviour and transition theory in explaining how socio-technical conditions may shape farmer’s decision-making. Empirically, we focus on the example of diversifying crop rotations with legumes as an established strategy to increase biodiversity and soil health, and reduce agrochemical use, emissions and pollution, which still remains rare in European agriculture. We use two cases in the Atlantic pedo-climatic region, Cornwall, UK, and Gelderland, Netherlands. Using in-depth interview data with farmers and extensive supplementary secondary data, we explore how context-specific socio-technical settings interact with farmers’ normative, gain-oriented and hedonic goal frames to shape the (un-)desirability of crop diversification with legumes. This creates conditions recognisable as cognitive lock-ins: the context of farmers’ decision-making creates cognitive processes that drastically reduce the perceived viability of alternative agricultural practices. Our findings in this case suggest the framework developed for this study may help to identify regionally specific, as well as common, barriers and solutions to crop diversification and comparable practices that are relevant to transitions towards sustainability in agri-food systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop diversification; Goal framing; Legumes; Lock-in; Sustainability transition","18624065","","","2-s2.0-85130251476"

Previous studies identifying the psychological predictors of pro-environmental behaviour rarely accounted for environmental impact. We studied the greenhouse gas emissions of clothing purchasing across four countries. Clothing purchasing is responsible for 2–3% of global emissions and severe, local environmental degradation. We found, using multiple regression analyses, that psychological factors like attitudes and personal norms strongly predicted a common self-reported behaviour scale of clothing purchasing but only weakly predicted clothing-related greenhouse gas emissions. This result challenges widespread inferences using pro-environmental behaviour scales and suggests that psychological factors may be a poor predictor of clothing-related environmental impact. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","23989629","","","2-s2.0-85129843639"

Using survey data (N = 217) collected in Norway among ‘to-be owners’ of battery electric vehicles and recent owners of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles regarding their performance of pro-environmental behaviours, we tested a multiple indicators and multiple causes model where intrinsic normative process and compensatory beliefs predict a behavioural score obtained by a Rasch model. The analysis showed that the personal norm was the strongest predictor of pro-environmental behaviours, while compensatory beliefs exert a significant negative influence on both personal norm and behaviours. Further, a significant difference in compensatory beliefs was found between ‘to-be owners’ of battery electric vehicles and recent owners of plug-in hybrid vehicles.

One reason for this is that more evidence is needed about the effectiveness of ESD interventions. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by examining the immediate and long-term effects of an ESD intervention on university students’ pro-environmental knowledge, personal environmental norm and pro-environmental behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quasi-experimental design that examined to what extent participating in an ESD intervention influenced university students’ self-reported pro-environmentalism (i.e. experimental group), compared to those who did not participate in the ESD intervention (i.e. control group). The authors also examined the longitudinal effects of the ESD intervention by recording students’ pro-environmentalism (both in the experimental and control group) 1 year after the intervention. Findings: The findings showed that participation in the ESD intervention enhanced students’ pro-environmental knowledge, personal environmental norms and pro-environmental behaviors relative to the no-participation control group. The positive effects of the ESD intervention remained 1 year after the program finished. Originality/value: This work explores the effects that ESD interventions have on university students. Its findings provide evidence about the effectiveness of the intervention and, therefore, support the inclusion of ESD at higher educational levels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental education; Environmental norms; Follow up; Higher education; Long term effects; Quasi-experimental design intervention","14676370","","","2-s2.0-85121369015"

There is good reason however to think that the nature of the PEB-wellbeing link might vary between individuals and cross-culturally. We use data obtained in Brazil, China, Denmark, India, Poland, South Africa and the UK (total n = 6969) to test a series of hypotheses using pre-registered regression models. First, we assess the relationship between PEB and wellbeing across countries, and test the ‘privilege’ hypothesis that this varies according to personal income and a country's level of development. Second, we consider the role of individual values and motivations in relation to PEB and wellbeing. To this end, we test the ‘enhancement’ hypothesis, in which the PEB-wellbeing link is strengthened by people holding particular values and motivations. Third, we consider the role of cultural differences for the nature of the PEB-wellbeing link. We test the ‘social green’ hypothesis that public sphere behaviours (e.g. addressing environmental issues with other people) are more closely linked to wellbeing than are private sphere behaviours (e.g. product purchasing) in collectivistic cultures; in tandem, we assess whether private sphere behaviours are more closely linked to wellbeing in individualistic cultures. We obtain strong evidence for a PEB-wellbeing link across nations. There is partial evidence across countries to support the ‘social green’ hypothesis, but little evidence for the ‘privilege’ or ‘enhancement’ hypotheses.

In this study we surveyed sustainability related attitudes and behaviors of students in 14 Hungarian secondary schools, as well as the efforts of their schools and teachers related to environmental and sustainability education.

This study reviews some of the major constructs employed within this area of research, and uses an information-theoretic approach to assess six models that position these constructs within different causal orderings to predict general pro-environmental behavior (G-PEB). The results indicate that environmental values and general environmental beliefs are distal drivers of engagement in G-PEB, and form the foundation—or primary motivational base—for environmental identity, concerns, attitudes, and norms that—directly and more proximally—influence this broad set of behaviors. This suggests that effective policies and interventions need to target both the proximal and distal influences on behavior, as well as the contexts and structures that support shared values and primary beliefs within a society or culture.

In merging these perspectives, this analysis uses ESS Round 8 data from 23 European countries to examine whether climate change scepticism and concern, pro-environmental personal norm and a willingness to engage in energy-saving behaviour exhibit, first, urban–rural and/or regional differences, and second, if these attitudes can be explained at individual level by socioeconomic position and wellbeing resources. We find that climate change scepticism and concern do exhibit urban–rural differences, where living in a country village is associated with greater climate scepticism and lower concern compared to living in a big city. Also, higher climate change concern and pro-environmental norms are associated with living in a region with constant population growth. These geographical differences are independent of individual-level socioeconomic attributes as well as one's political orientation. Additionally, the results show that both climate change attitudes and reporting energy-saving behaviour are strongly stratified by level of education and reveal that those in lower income deciles feel less pro-environmental norm but nonetheless report greater engagement with energy-saving behaviour. In sum, the results highlight that climate change mitigation is not a uniform project either spatially or within certain socioeconomic strata. Hence, our results suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage (belonging to the lowest education and income levels) and spatial marginalisation (living in more rural surroundings and declining regions) should be better acknowledged when reworking climate change and environmental policies in the EU. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Climate change attitudes; Pro-environmental behaviour; Social exclusion; Spatial justice; Urban–rural differences","09593780","","GECHE","2-s2.0-85123234463"

This article explores the broad process of encountering eco-anxiety and ecological grief, and engages in the constructive task of building a new model of that process. Eco-anxiety and grief are here seen as fundamentally healthy reactions to threats and loss, and only the strongest forms of them are seen as problems. The aim is to help researchers, various professionals and the general public by providing a model which is (a) simple enough but (b) more nuanced than stage models which may give a false impression of linearity. The article uses an interdisciplinary method. The proposed new model includes both chronological and thematic aspects. The early phases of Unknowing and Semi-consciousness are followed potentially by some kind of Awakening and various kinds of Shock and possible trauma. A major feature of the model is the following complex phase of Coping and Changing, which is framed as consisting of three major dimensions: Action (pro-environmental behavior of many kinds), Grieving (including other emotional engagement), and Distancing (including both self-care and problematic disavowal). The model predicts that if there is trouble in any of these three dimensions, adjusting will be more difficult. The model thus helps in seeing, e.g., the importance of self-care for coping. The possibility of stronger eco-anxiety and/or eco-depression is always present, including the danger of burnout. The ethical and psychological aim is called Adjustment and Transformation, which includes elements of, e.g., meaning-finding and acceptance. The need for Coping and Changing continues, but there is more awareness and flexibility in a metaphase of Living with the Ecological Crisis, where the titles and subtitles of the three dimensions of coping are switched. © 2022 by the author.","bereavement; climate anxiety; climate grief; Dual Process Model; eco-anxiety; eco-emotion; ecological grief; process model; solastalgia","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85144925899"

This study aimed to determine if environmental perceptions and place attachment concepts in our study area (within Gauteng province, South Africa) showed specific spatial patterns. Hot spot, cluster-outlier analysis, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to depict the spatial patterns of environmental perceptions and place attachment. Results showed a pattern where the central, generally affluent wards of the province hold more positive environmental perceptions and place attachment than those in the periphery. This is in line with dependency and other models that associate lower socioeconomic status with lower levels of environmental awareness but is incongruent with other findings that have associated lower socio-economic status with pro-environmental behaviour being more prominent. Geographically weighted regression results revealed the combined importance of numbers of people with above-average income, college-level education, age below 50 years, female proportion, formal dwelling residence and African race in explaining the numbers of people with positive views on place attachment and environmental perceptions. Further, the GWR modelling allowed for the spatial dependence of the relationship between place attachment and environmental perceptions on the one hand and socio-economic factors on the other.

Aligning with the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, this paper proposes a new framework for residents’ quality-of-life. Bringing together multi-disciplinary evidence from environmental, social and cognitive psychology, political science and tourism, this study critically examines how residents’ perceived social impacts of tourism and their interpersonal trust can make them become more place attached and protect their tourism resources. The framework proposes that residents’ perceived social impacts of tourism exerts a direct influence on residents’ interpersonal trust. It further posits that residents’ perceived social impacts of tourism and their interpersonal trust exert a direct influence on residents’ place attachment. The proposed model further considers place attachment to exert a direct influence on residents’ pro-social and pro-environmental behavioural intentions. Pro-social behaviour is proposed to influence pro-environmental behaviour. Further pro-social and pro-environmental behaviours are proposed to influence residents’ support for tourism development. The framework then considers residents’ support for tourism development to exert a direct influence on residents’ overall quality-of-life.

Situating social practice theory in the larger framework of the political economy of low-carbon transformation provides a holistic and grounded perspective on consumer behaviour change and potential for social transformation. In contrast to conventional individualistic and rationalist approaches, our study suggests that there is no linear path of transformation; rather, people join community-supported agriculture to use their consumer power to push for social transformation. Simultaneously, community-supported agriculture influences a reorientation of values and practices because it opens up opportunities and resources for sustainable lifestyles. We argue that the collaborative aspects of community-supported agriculture can challenge unsustainable consumption by emphasizing sharing over private ownership and frugality over accumulation of growth. However, the consumer practices of the wider political economy produced by the ‘culture of capitalism’ continue to be ingrained in people’s social relations and contexts, and thus weaken new and more sustainable forms of food consumption. © 2022 The Authors.

Meanwhile, children's pro-environmental behaviour in emerging Asian nations tends to be passive, leading to a need for intervention from the closest parties, often the parent, whose familial role in green communication has not been examined. This study uses social learning theory to examine the interplay of parent-like spokespeople and message appeals in affecting young adults' cognitive and emotional responses, which is expected to influence the ad liking and believability of green advertisements and switching intention to green products, such as eco-friendly straws. A laboratory experiment was conducted with 240 subjects. The results showed that the frame of a father-like figure conveying a hope appeal generated the greatest enthusiasm and argument quality for young adults. Mother-like figures speaking a fearful message frame were the best generator for young adults' anger and threat appraisal. Ad liking was significantly impacted only by a mother-like spokesperson who spoke a fearful appeal mediated by anger and a father-like spokesperson who delivered a hope appeal mediated by argument quality. Young adults' willingness to switch to eco-friendly straws was indirectly influenced by the interaction effect of a mother-like spokesperson and fear appeal type mediated by ad believability. © 2022 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","green advertising; message appeals; message framing; parent-like spokesperson; plastic straws","13672223","","","2-s2.0-85137532544"

Yet, the inertia typically associated with behavior change to limit climate change stands in contrast to the speed associated with behavior change to stop the spread of COVID-19. Identifying the roots of these differences can help us stimulate climate-friendly behaviors. We assessed the extent to which a number of theory-based drivers underlie behaviors aiming to counter COVID-19 and climate change with an online survey (N = 534). We focused on the role of a number of drivers derived from prominent behavior change theories and meta-analyses in the field, namely, personal threat, threat to close others, threat to vulnerable others, fear, participative efficacy, injunctive and descriptive social norms, and governmental policy perceptions. We investigated (1) what drivers people perceived as most important to engage in behaviors that limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change and (2) the strength of the associations between these drivers and engaging in behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic and climate change. Results highlight three key drivers for climate change action: changing perceptions of governmental policy and perceptions of threat to close others and priming participative efficacy beliefs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Behavior change; Climate change; COVID-19; Pro-environmental behavior","21906483","","","2-s2.0-85120632185"

Two competing hypotheses can be delineated. On the one hand, a synergy logic would imply that welfare state generosity is associated with higher support for environmental action among economically vulnerable groups due to the insecurity reducing effects of the welfare state. On the other hand, a crowding-out logic would suggest that welfare state generosity is associated with lower support for other policy priorities like environmental action. We test these two hypotheses using 2019 Eurobarometer survey data and country-level indicators of welfare state generosity in 22 European countries. We find that the working class and the elderly are particularly opposed to individual and national environmental action and that the welfare state plays a complex moderating role. Consistent with a synergy logic, welfare state generosity increases pro-environmental behaviour among the working class, but its association with more positive attitudes towards national environmental policies is less strong. Consistent with a crowding-out logic, the elderly appear less likely to behave in environmentally friendly ways if retirement benefits are high. To explore the mechanisms behind this association, we show that the working class who struggle to pay their bills are most opposed to environmental action. Overall, economic insecurities are key obstacles for support of environmental actions and the effects of the welfare state depend both on which social group is concerned and whether individual behaviour versus policy preferences are considered. © The Author(s) 2022.","climate change mitigation; environmental preferences; Eurobarometer; pensioners; social classes; Welfare state","09589287","","","2-s2.0-85139030493"

Most of the previous research considered tourists exert green behavior independently, neglecting the influences of tourist-to-tourist interaction and the culture they are embedded in. This study took Chinese tourists visiting two lake tourism destinations (West Lake in Hangzhou and Xianshan Lake in Huzhou) as the research respondents and aimed to examine how tourist-to-tourist interaction within different relationships impact tourist on-site green behavior in Chinese face-culture settings. Based on a qualitative research approach using the critical incident technique, 76 incidents were investigated involving 29 Chinese tourists with different backgrounds. This research showed that the encounters among tourists were affected by the types of relationships (family, friends, and strangers) and Chinese face culture (the desire to gain face and the fear of losing face). The results contribute to the sustainable tourism literature by taking into consideration various types of social interactions, which positively or negatively affect green behavior. Fresh insights are revealed on how face consciousness influences Chinese social interactions and green behavior in tourism. The analysis of social interactions among tourists provides a new perspective for destination management organizations to enhance green behavior and improve sustainable management practices. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese culture; critical incident technique; face consciousness; green behavior; Tourist-to-tourist interactions","14766825","","","2-s2.0-85135252880"

Cases were interdisciplinary and focused on sustainable development goals aligned with common worldwide dilemmas like, for example, food consumption, organic farm or nature protection. Our sample consisted of 104 university students aged between 18 and 58 years, where 53% were female. Standardized pre-and post-tests were administered, and a significant improvement in sustainable development knowledge was observed considering three main questions in the pooled dataset (t103 = −7.324; p = 0.000). Regarding the four cases applications where results were more significant, an in-depth analysis was conducted, allowing the project team to better understand participants answers to multiple-choice and open questions which are analysed and discussed individually. Our results demonstrate that the case-based teaching improved the knowledge of sustainable development goals, which is expected to induce positive changes in pro-environmental behaviours. We also point out the potential of case-based teaching applied in a cross-country manner.

Governance refers to the institutions, organizations, and people involved in and affected by socio-ecological practices (SEPs), such as research, planning, design, construction, restoration, conservation, and management. The complexity of SESs requires the ability to understand and identify how the social world produces differential opportunities, constraints, and resources across multiple levels and scales of governance systems and as a consequence undesirable SEP outcomes for social equity, human well-being, and environmental integrity. This paper presents a complex adaptive governance systems framework (CAGS-F) designed to provide guidance, organization, and basic conceptualizations of social scientific concepts and terms for diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry into SEPs for the purpose of improving justice and sustainability. CAGS-F is unique for synthesizing the panarchy heuristic’s focus on socio-ecological interdependence, cross-scalar, multi-causal, non-linear complexity, and change with compatible social scientific theories of multi-level institutions, organizations, and human practices. The framework works from a critical realist orientation to reveal how power and privilege embedded in institutions, organizations, and human practices produce inequitable and/or undesirable SEP outcomes. The structure of the framework employs analytic dualism to provide a way to identify where, at what level and scale, who is included and/or adversely affected, and at which point in discrete adaptive cycles across institutional, organizational, and human practices opportunities, barriers, and leverage points exist so as to optimize design, planning, programming, and implementation of SEPs or evaluate unintended and unforeseen, less than successful, inequitable, and/or undesirable outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Adaptive cycles; Critical realism; Intersectionality; Panarchy; Power; Stratification","25245279","","","2-s2.0-85160939350"

Decades of research in social sciences have offered complementary insights into how such transformations might occur. However, these insights largely remain disjunct and of limited scope, such that strategies for solving global environmental challenges remain elusive. There is a need to integrate approaches focusing on individuals and social structures to understand how individual actions influence and are in turn influenced by social structures and norms. In this paper, we synthesize a range of insights across different schools of thought and integrate them in a novel framework for transformative social change. Our framework explains the relationships among individual behaviors, collective actions, and social structures and helps change agents guide societal transitions toward environmental sustainability. We apply this framework to the global wildlife trade—which presents several distinct challenges of human actions, especially amidst the Covid-19 pandemic—and identify pathways toward transformative change. One key distinction we make is between different individual actions that comprise the practice itself (e.g., buying wildlife products; private action) and those that push for a broader system change in practice (e.g., signaling (dis)approval for wildlife consumption; social-signaling action, and campaigning for policies that end unsustainable wildlife trade; system-changing action). In general, transformative change will require an integrative approach that includes both structural reforms and all three classes of individual action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Behavior change; Collective action; Pro-environmental behavior; Social diffusion; Social-ecological systems; Transformative change","18624065","","","2-s2.0-85123233516"

This may be because schools are pioneers or are often used as platforms for many environmental advocacies. Years of research have demonstrated that teaching increases awareness and concern for the environment and encourages people to protect the environment, however there is a deficit in the literature that probed and determined which among teacher activities may be considered as pro-environmental behavior. Purpose: This study attempted to determine the influence of values, beliefs and norms in teaching disaster risk reduction. This paper attempted to reflect on teaching and environmentalism as deduced from the findings and aims to stimulate and contribute to the discussion on teaching and environmentalism. Participants: Data were gathered from 185 public school science teachers teaching from grades 3 to 6 under the Department of Education–Division of Biliran located in one of the highly natural hazard-vulnerable islands in the Philippines. Participants were selected through random sampling of schools. All science teachers of the schools drawn were asked to voluntarily participate in the study. Design and methods: This quantitative study made use of survey design using adapted and content-validated Likert scale questionnaire on values, beliefs and norms in teaching disaster risk reduction. Data collected were analyzed through partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using Smart PLS. Conclusion: Results conform to the Value-Belief-Norm Theory of Environmentalism, which suggest that teacher activities pertaining to the integration and teaching of disaster risk reduction in science lie within the continuum of environmentalism, therefore, they may be considered pro-environmental behavior. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Disaster risk reduction; environmentalism; teaching; Value-Belief-Norm Theory","02635143","","","2-s2.0-85114873429"

For this reason, understanding how time perception shapes the misalignments, the so called “Value-Action gap”, is the objective of the paper. We analyse both individual (related to job motivation) and social determinants (related to the imitation of pro-environmental behaviours). While the former group refers to the way time is actually perceived, by using variables depicting the way work pressure is felt, the latter group acknowledges the possibility that a social norm is embodied into people and, being imitable, it can help acting in accordance with social environmental attitudes. The empirical analysis exploits the World Bank 3rd Wave of the World Values Survey, covering the years 1995–1998 on 34 countries, and it confirms that time perception and imitation both contribute to the decrease of VAG, although to a different extent. © 2022, The Author(s).","Environmental attitude; Environmental behaviour; Value action gap","11202890","","","2-s2.0-85136784199"

Many empirical studies have found modest positive effects, suggesting that attitudes toward the environment might indeed influence environmental behavior. However, most of the previous empirical work is cross-sectional and correlational in nature. This means that the issue of the causal effect of environmental attitudes on behavior is far from settled, and that the relationships observed in the past may be due to unobserved confounders. In a panel study using six waves of the GESIS Panel Survey, we examine the individual-level effect of changes in one’s attitudes on changes in different forms of environmental behavior. We use fixed effects panel regression within the structural equation modeling framework to control for unobserved time-invariant confounders, while also tackling other methodological challenges. We find that environmental attitudes have no effect on behavior after controlling for unobserved confounders. However, there is a robust effect of attitudes on willingness to sacrifice. This suggests that creating more positive attitudes might make individuals more willing to accept sacrifices for environmental protection. © 2022, The Author(s).","Attitudes and behavior; Fixed effects; Panel analysis; Structural equation modeling; Willingness to pay/sacrifice","00232653","","","2-s2.0-85139462788"

This study explores the mechanisms influencing pro-environmental behaviors by applying social capital theory. Drawing upon the data from the Chinese General Social Survey in 2013 (CGSS2013), this study distinguishes social capital in two dimensions—individual social capital (ISC) and collective social capital (CSC)—and classifies pro-environmental behaviors into two categories: private and public. With a multiple linear regression model, the report reveals that ISC, based on network learning, social support, and social identity, and CSC, based on social norms and social trust, have significant positive effects on both private and public pro-environmental behaviors. The effect of CSC on pro-environmental behavior is much lower than that of ISC. In addition, females are more likely to perform private pro-environmental behaviors than males. This paper argues that social capital should be actively used to promote civic engagement in China’s environmental protection process. © 2022 by the authors.","collective social capital; individual social capital; private pro-environmental behavior; public pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85148084896"

Managers of organizations are increasingly expected to duly consider and demonstrate the desired social and environmental intentions of translating leadership strategies into sustainable practices. Studies on employees' voluntary environmental behavior (VEB) are increasing in number, in that it is believed that behavior can contribute to achieving organizational sustainability strategy. However, despite the studies being published on this emerging field, leadership is a missing link regarding the psychological mechanism through which VEB can be defined and refined. Drawing on the theories of social learning and social exchange, this study seeks to establish the impact of ecocentric leadership (EL) on VEB and the mediating role of psychological green climate (PGC) in this nexus. Data were collected from wide-ranging business organizations in Bangladesh through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The results indicate that EL wields a significant direct influence on VEB. Moreover, EL through the mediating effect of PGC indirectly shapes VEB. The study contributes original insights to the discussions and debates on strategic leadership and climate accountability.

This qualitative phenomenographic study collected data via individual semi-structured interviews with five early childhood teachers and one head teacher, in Malta. Preliminary findings revealed that the participants perceived environmental sustainability in terms of environmental concerns; environmental responsibility; and environmental protection. A mismatch between the participants' environmental concerns and their pro-environmental behaviour emerged. The data also show that any environmental activities at school were done so uncritically. These findings hold importance for the reorientation of in-service and pre-service early childhood teacher education programs towards sustainability to ensure that systems thinking around critical environmental issues are introduced in the early years by addressing gaps in knowledge and supporting educators' development at the earliest stage (i.e., pre-service). © 2022 Social Science Press.

Consequently, research findings may over- or underestimate the effects of environmental variables of interest when analyzing cross-level interactions. This research contextualizes environmental behavior in the European Union, a set of socioeconomically different countries that share a common institutional framework. We explore the effects of country-level drivers on behavior after controlling for individual-level drivers using multilevel regression analysis to estimate the impact of country-level drivers on both the mean behavior of individuals and cross-level interactions. The direct impact of country-level drivers on pro-environmental behaviors was as expected: country affluence and income inequality had positive and negative impacts, respectively, whereas country education level, environmental issues, and cultural values had no direct impact. Nonetheless, in terms of cross-level interactions, country education level increased the effect of perceived behavioral control on behaviors. In Western countries, the influence of country affluence and education level on behavior, operating through social-psychological drivers, maybe underpinned by different socioeconomic mechanisms. Income may not be enough to change perceptions of reality, but income can be transformed into cultural capital that, in turn, may change socially ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","country development; environmental attitudes; European Union; pro-environmental behavior; socio-psychological drivers","23251042","","","2-s2.0-85121650505"

This circumstance makes it necessary to educate young people who are receptive to global challenges and ready to solve the urgent problems of our time. The purpose of the article is to analyze the experience of the environmental behavior of young people in the metropolis. The authors studied articles and monographs that contain Russian and international experience in the environmental behavior of citizens. The following factors determine people’s behavior: the cognitive capabilities of people who determine the understanding and perception of nature and the value-affective component that determines the attitude towards nature. The next task of the study is surveying young people through an online survey and its analysis. The research was realized in Ekaterinburg, the administrative center of the Sverdlovsk region (Russia). The study of the current ecological situation in Ekaterinburg made it possible to conclude that the environmental problem arises not only and not simply as a problem of environmental pollution and other negative influences of human economic activity. This problem grows into transforming the spontaneous impact of society on nature into a consciously, purposefully, systematically developing harmonious interaction with it. The study results showed that, from the point of view of the youth of Ekaterinburg, the city’s ecological situation is one of the most pressing problems. Despite minor improvements over the past 3–5 years, this problem has not lost relevance, and regional authorities and city residents should be responsible for its solution. Young people know environmental practices, but they often do not apply them systematically. Ecological behavior is encouraged and discussed among friends/acquaintances. The key factors influencing the formation of environmental behavior practices are the mass media and social networks. The most popular social network for obtaining information on ecological practices among young people is Instagram, and the key persons are bloggers. This study did not reveal the influence of the socio-demographic characteristics of young people on the application of eco-behavior practices, which may indicate the need for a survey of a larger sample. © 2021 by the authors.

Heterogeneity tests show that more affluent regions are more committed to investing in education, raising consumption, and increasing wages under the RCP. These results suggest that local governments in China have responded rationally and strategically to the RCP.

Additionally, this paper aims to explore the relationship between waste separation practices and social bonds. Design/methodology/approach: The Travis Hirschi theory of social control was applied, together with the mixed method research design which included a structured questionnaire survey. Twelve semi-structured interviews were also conducted with residents and the data processed by SPSS software, using Chi-Square test, Independent-Samples t-test and Pearson's correlation analysis. Findings: A proportion of respondents has continued practicing waste separation since the 3R project ended. The study also indicated that the greater the involvement in family and neighborhood activities the more the participants were likely to practice waste separation. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size limits the extent to which the most influential factors can be determined and therefore the degree to which the findings can be generalized. Practical implications: The study includes implications for rerunning the waste separation programs for households as together with community campaigns to improve individuals' attachment and commitment and thus their participation in pro-environmental behaviors. Originality/value: To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to take a sociological approach to investigate factors affecting household waste separation, which has attracted little attention in previous studies. Useful information is also provided to local authorities for a policy-making process to implement effective domestic waste policies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","An individual's waste separation practice; Community bonds; Family bonds; Hanoi; Social bonds; Vietnam","0144333X","","","2-s2.0-85112184092"

We use semi-structured and open-ended interviews to collect data, which we analyze thematically. We discuss the reasons for the emergence of the ICs in the Belbek Valley and the variety of different ICs and initiatives there and build a typology of the ICs. They stand in stark contrast with neighboring traditional villages in Crimea. The Belbek Valley’s ICs are small-scale alternatives to the mainstream lifestyle, and they aim for a low carbon footprint, practicing permaculture, the application of energy and water saving technologies, vegetarianism, and yoga. The number of environmental practices adopted by each IC depends on the scale of their activities and investments in the infrastructure.

Little is known about the perception of the rural population itself on the reconciling of high quality of life with sustainability. Thus, based on a concept of sustainable quality of life, qualitative interviews with 90 rural residents were conducted to ask them which factors benefit sustainable quality of life. In the perception of the interview participants, a change in attitudes and values would be a starting point for shaping many other areas to enhance sustainable quality of life; social and legal norms should provide reference points for individuals and economic actors; infrastructure should support individuals in their ecological behaviour; and the economy should serve the common good.

This study’s objectives were to identify possible barriers faced by older persons to increase their pro-environmental behaviors and participation in the climate movement. Relying on in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups with 50 older persons from four different population groups in Israel, we identified three themes. The first theme concerned assigning responsibility for the current climate situation. This theme addressed the question of who is seen as responsible for the current situation. The second theme covered actions taken by older persons to address the current situation. Finally, older persons view governments/municipalities, industry, and individuals as responsible for the changing climate, with a more traditional segment of the population also viewing God as responsible. Moreover, although governments were identified as important institutions with relevance to the current climate challenge, respondents mainly acknowledged the relevance of pro-environmental behaviors rather than climate change activism. In conclusion, the findings highlight the need to increase environmental activism among older persons. It is also important to increase the breadth of possible pro-environmental behaviors older persons can engage with. © 2022 by the authors.","activism; barriers; climate change; facilitators; older persons; pro-environmental; responsibility","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85144897738"

The energy-saving behavior of employees in the workplace contributes to the reduction of air pollution and carbon emissions, and there is basically no need to consider individual utilitarian factors in PEB-related research. Therefore, this study investigates the direct and indirect effects of environmental concerns on employees’ behavioral intentions to save energy in the offices of Chinese Internet companies to better understand the inconsistent results found for environmental concern and PEB. A study of a sample of 364 employees in three Chinese developed cities shows that perceived behavioral control has the greatest direct impact on employees’ energy-saving behavior in offices, followed by energy-saving attitudes, personal moral norm and subjective descriptive norms. The direct effects of environmental concern and subjective injunctive norms on behavioral intentions to save energy were found to be small. However, environmental concern, as an antecedent variable to the above elements, can have a significant impact on employees’ office energy-saving behaviors through the mediating role of these elements, thus rendering employees’ environmental concern deserving of more attention.

However, activists are targeted with negative stereotypes, hindering their influence. Young activists are environmentally conscious, but the stereotypical attributions assigned to them are unknown, with competing predictions in the literature (for being activist vs being young). In two studies, we aimed at experimentally examining the stereotypical dimensions that are ascribed to activists (youth vs adult) based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), as well as a morality/trustworthiness dimension. Considering that activists are generally considered as high-competent, but low-warm, while youth are considered the opposite (low-competence and high-warmth), we hypothesized the impacts on morality/trustworthiness. Greta Thunberg and Jane Fonda were the personalities used in Study 1 (N = 276), randomly assigned to participants while keeping the same discourse excerpt. Thunberg was penalized in all stereotypical dimensions. In Study 2 (N = 228), fictional characters (teenager or adult) were used instead. As hypothesized, no differences were found in the warmth or competence dimensions, only in the morality/trustworthiness dimension, penalizing the young activist. These results highlight the importance of studying environmental activists considering different social categories in stereotypical appraisals. They also contribute to a better understanding of general resistance towards activists, as well as the factors that are detrimental to their social influence. © 2022 by the authors.","environmental activism; pro-environmental behavior; stereotype content model; stereotypical attributions; youth","20760760","","","2-s2.0-85140585858"

I used this tool to examine students’ enactment of action and ideas about action on a continuum from individual to collaborative changemaking and the intended outcome of action as directed at behavior transformation or system transformation. Action across scale is necessary for addressing socioenvironmental challenges more justly. These findings suggest possibilities and challenges for designing action-oriented learning environments that support heterogeneous outcomes and more collective action. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","action; Climate change; pro-environmental behavior; secondary; sustainability","13504622","","","2-s2.0-85124248738"

This research is part of a broader debate on the nature of individual pro-environmental behavior and whether it can be considered a political act. Studies generally show a positive association between pro-environmental behavior and political activism. However, few have differentiated between types of pro-environmental behavior. In contrast, our study uses Flemish survey data to examine the relationship between political activism and different modes of pro-environmental behavior: sustainable transport, shopping decisions, energy curtailment, and waste sorting. The results are generally consistent with previous studies. Political activism was positively related to sustainable transport, shopping decisions, and waste sorting. However, it was negatively associated with energy curtailment. Results thus suggest that energy curtailment may displace political action. In conclusion, by differentiating between various modes of pro-environmental behavior, our study confirms but also nuances the usefulness of concepts such as sustainable citizenship. These notions often frame individual pro-environmental behavior as part of broader political and collective strategies to address environmental issues. Our study shows that this may exclude some forms of ecologically significant behavior such as energy curtailment. © 2022 by the authors.","crowding-in; crowding-out; environmentalism; political activism; social class","20754698","","","2-s2.0-85140638242"

Negative attitudes toward the environment plus disinterest have led to improper behavior, influencing climate change and global warming. Awareness could have a positive environmental impact by influencing attitudes and behaviors. One way to generate awareness and ensure positive behavior is through education. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), a 33-questions survey was implemented to college students from Texas, Louisiana, and Honduras to (1) compare students’ environmental attitudes, behaviors, and subjective norms at the three universities; and (2) predict how much of the undergraduate students’ environmental behavior variance could be explained by their environmental attitude, subjective norms, and perceived environmental knowledge. Multivariate analysis of variance and hierarchical regressions were performed to address the objectives, respectively. Results showed that Honduras and Louisiana students’ environmental attitudes, behavior, and subjective norms are significantly different than Texas students, and TRA variables increased the prediction of behavior variance by 15%.

Through interviews and document review, we examine two initiatives involving different non-formal educational actions in Barcelona: a civic ecology practice based on the community gardening of tree pits and an energy citizenship project with the school community. Despite their diverse nature and outcomes, these educational actions promoted by grassroots groups intend to boost young people’s critical reflection, responsibility, and agency for taking individual action towards more climate-resilient cities. However, connections between agency, empowerment and transformative learning become more challenging when translated to the collective. Limitations relate to the lack of effective engagement approaches that reinforce social connectedness and local identity, and insufficient evaluation strategies.

This study aims to bridge the gap of scarce research on task-related EGB by integrating both cognitive and non-cognitive factors as an extension to the theory of planned behavior. Task-related EGB refers to employees pro-environmental behaviors performed as part of routine tasks and roles. Using principal component analysis and structural equation modeling, the survey findings from 302 employee participants reveal that both cognitive and non-cognitive factors significantly influence the task-related EGB. In addition to this theoretical contribution, this study's findings suggest that creating positive environmental attitudes and habits via pro-environmental policies, procedures, and practices in the workplace can enhance employees' task-related EGB. The provision of access to information, training, and other resources regarding pro-environmental behavior in the workplace may also have an impact. Besides, the results validate the underexplored mediating role of environmental attitudes and pro-environmental habits between individual-level predictors and task-related EGB in the workplace.

Data from a sample of 680 hotel guests reveal significant gender differences, with specific factors affecting the WCB of guests of each gender. Attitudes exert a positive influence on guests’ WCB. This influence is greater for women than for men. Normative motives also positively influence attitudes, although this effect is greater for men than for women. Conversely, hedonic motives negatively influence water conservation attitudes, and this effect is greater for women than for men.

The issue of plastic pollution has emerged as a major global environmental challenge in the last decade, and it has not been immune to neoliberal logics. Actors within the plastic industry have long attempted to deflect regulatory attention and public scrutiny by placing responsibility for recycling and appropriate disposal onto consumers. Despite these efforts, plastic control discourses have been gaining ground. In this article, through the case study of India, I argue that stakeholder responses to these discourses and to plastic control policies are affected by the internal dynamics of the plastic sector. Moreover, as a result of these inter-sectoral dynamics, anticipatory changes in the market can be driven by anti-plastic discourses. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anti-plastic discourses; India; neoliberal environmentalism; plastic control policy; plastic industry; Plastics","09644016","","","2-s2.0-85123442506"

Managing this nature-based activity requires understanding birdwatchers’ attitudes and behaviour towards the natural environment. This paper proposes assessing these attitudes and the link to behavioural intentions by combining the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) with a criterion-based segmentation method, the chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID). This methodology was applied through a survey questionnaire to birdwatchers in the Ria Formosa Natural Park, a wetland located in South Portugal. The amount birdwatchers were willing to pay for an improvement in the environmental quality of the site, a behavioural intention variable, was used as the criterion in the CHAID analysis. Two birdwatcher segments willing to pay above average were identified and labelled as ‘environmental stewards’ and ‘birdwatching fans’. A key result that emerged from our study is that the NEP score is not a significant predictor of the willingness to pay for environmental improvement in the CHAID analysis. Hence, there is a missing link, as pro-environmental attitudes do not translate into pro-environmental behavioural intentions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Birdwatching; CHAID; environmental attitudes; environmental behaviour; New Environmental Paradigm","02508281","","","2-s2.0-85106234545"

The ISSP Environment Module is a repeated cross-sectional large-scale survey in Germany covering a period of nearly 30 years with four survey waves (1993, 2000, 2010, and 2020). We find that environmental attitude, willingness, and behavior are relatively stable between 1993 and 2010 in Germany. However, in the fourth wave, we find a significant upward trend in attitude and willingness compared to 2010—even though the COVID-19 pandemic was omnipresent at the time of the survey. This could indicate that climate change and environmental issues have gained such significance that they cannot easily be fully displaced by other major events, such as a pandemic. Moreover, we detect systematic heterogeneity in environmental attitude, willingness, and behavior predominantly with respect to respondents’ education, residential region, and political orientation but also some heterogeneity regarding gender, age, and income. Finally, we reveal that the dynamic of environmental attitude, willingness, and behavior also depends on certain socio-demographic characteristics, such as residential region, or political orientation. Our findings are essential for a better understanding of the social feasibility of transformation pathways towards a sustainable energy system. © 2022 by the authors.","energy transition pathways; environmental attitudes; heterogeneity analysis; pro-environmental behavior; sustainable energy system; willingness to pay","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85143643265"

They offer the “treat” of customer-friendly unlimited food intake at the expense of environmentally harmful plate waste at the end of the meal. When the right “tricks” are employed, consumers’ wasteful, anti-environmental behaviours can be changed, with significant positive effects on food waste volume and restaurant earnings. A field experiment was conducted for this study. First, in Study 1, a test of both moral and financial interventions under two serving conditions was conducted for 360 subjects to find the most effective combination of interventions and serving styles in mitigating food waste volume. Second, building upon the findings from Study 1, a random sample of 45 female and 45 male subjects were examined to test the differential effects of consumer characteristics (gender, age, occupation, and dining purpose) on food waste behaviour. The results show that while management interventions were equally effective regardless of gender, age, and occupation, consumers dining for the purpose of sociability (as compared to dining simply for sustenance) were less affected by either moral or financial interventions. The study of food waste mitigation also provides insights into effective management interventions for environmentally friendly consumer behaviours in a wide range of hospitality industries. © 2022","Buffet restaurants; Consumer behaviour; Field experiment; Food waste; Sustainability","1878450X","","","2-s2.0-85132422521"

The understanding of property management enterprises’ ecological behavior, however, is rather limited. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the mechanism of the affecting factors upon the ecological behavior of property management enterprises. The qualitative analysis method was used to collect and identify the influencing factors, which were further classified as those of stimulus, status, scenario, and result. A theoretical model of the action mechanism of influencing factors and related hypotheses has been constructed based on the planned behavior theory. The proposed hypotheses have been empirically analyzed by the quantitative analysis of a questionnaire survey. The results indicate that there are significant differences in ecological behavior implementation under different status factors, while the impact of enterprise nature on property management ecological behavior is not significant. Regarding the stimulus factors, market pressure and government regulation are the main external incentive factors. The scenario factors could be resistant forces and moderate the implementation of ecological behavior. For the result factors, property management enterprises pay attention to whether the implementation of ecological behavior can produce direct benefits. The research findings constitute valuable references for further development of the property management industry. © 2022 by the authors.","action mechanism; China; ecological behavior; influencing factors; property management; theoretical model","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85142766063"

We argue that microscale space–time paths fail to account for contextual determinants of behavior, because they emphasize “contacts” over “contexts,” a problem that could be solved, in part, by using a broader “generalized” representation of geographic context. This article develops the idea of a generalized activity space and empirically tests the viability of the concept. Support for the viability of the idea is identified through analysis of 34,500 trips by 7,550 individuals in Atlanta. We find that demographic characteristics and residential location jointly shape a person’s geographic context. Through a series of hypothesis tests, we find evidence that these location–demographic groupings are generalizable; that is, people with similar socioeconomic backgrounds and residential locations exhibit similar generalized activity spaces. Residential location, by itself, however, is not an effective descriptor of the configuration of a person’s context. We argue that generalized activity spaces have potential to inform study of how the environment influences behavior by allowing a more robust consideration of interplay between socioeconomic characteristics and the use of space. © 2022 by American Association of Geographers.","activity space; context; environment-behavior; neighborhood effects","24694452","","","2-s2.0-85133687369"

Yet, ecological behaviors cannot be improved only by attending to personal variables; focus must also be put on the collective variables. The main aim of this research was to analyze how individual variables (environmental values) and collective variables (collective efficacy for ecological behavior) interact to explain recycling (Study 1; 502 students of Spanish universities) and energy-saving behaviors (Study 2; 544 students of Ecuadorian universities). Participants completed an online questionnaire that reflected all the studied variables. Ecological behaviors were collected through frequency scales. The results of the moderated analyses performed with Process for SPSS confirmed the moderating effect of collective efficacy in the relationship that both preservation and appreciation established with recycling and energy-saving behavior alike. This moderating effect was also confirmed in the relationship that utilization developed with recycling, but not with energy saving. Thus, collective efficacy directly influences pro-environmental behavior, but also interacts with the personal values of individuals. Consequently, the results indicate the need to encourage collective efficacy for ecological behaviors of individuals, groups, collectives, and communities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Appreciation of nature value; Collective efficacy; Energy saving; Preservation value; Recycling; Utilization value","1387585X","","EDSNB","2-s2.0-85109320673"

Viewing Earth as a spaceship amenable to human guidance and control makes sense only if we also accept the power of dominant “centers of calculation” that gather and disseminate standardized knowledge instrumentally to ensure global coordination. Stewardship, by contrast, relies on infrastructures of lo-cally shared values and distributed innovation in human-nature relations rather than on universal scientific knowledge or technology. Stewardship is often propagated by social movements seeking to promote globally sustainable ecological practices.

The analysis traces how the education contributes to gaining knowledge about natural and climate change, as well as the pro-ecological behavior of people around the ecosystems. The paper is based on empirical results from qualitative methods on the topic of environmental citizenship. Two main methods are used: Document and policy analysis; this method examines the involvement of political actors with the environmental issue and especially of the Ministry of Education in a national context. The other methods used are also qualitative: Interviews (19) with educational experts and students, as well as focus groups (3) with students from different universities.

Knowledge management involves managing tacit and explicit information in a way that ensures it is available where and when needed. From a knowledge management perspective, environmental learning refers to the processes of acquiring, distributing and using knowledge of the natural environment, involving the processes of socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation of knowledge and its central aim is to improve performance. This article describes how knowledge management and organisational learning can help to achieve a sustainable tourism sector. Sustainability in this context is understood as efforts to progress simultaneously in environmental, societal and economic development. The article argues that the principles of sustainable tourism lead to both improved strategies and avenues for future research, provided they are informed and supported by learning and knowledge management; value co-creation; co-operation and trust-building; corporate social responsibility and pro-environmental behaviour. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate social responsibility; knowledge management; Organisational learning; pro-environmental behaviour; sustainability knowledge; sustainable tourism","09669582","","","2-s2.0-85131668419"

It examines the value of the environment as a result of state-public firm relations grounded on the multiple and often conflicting demands within the changing context and requirements of the EU environmental policy. By process-tracing two Romanian SOEs in the coal energy industry, the paper looks into: i) the hierarchical coordination and negotiation systems of state and SOEs in relation to the environment; ii) how the economic and political elites deal with the competition on free markets and use various mechanisms to empower the survival of SOEs that eventually translate into economic performance and environmental behavior. The findings suggest the salient decapitalization of SOEs due to the state behavior embedded in confusing procedures and actions that made room for political maneuvering. Also, the organizational culture of working in a “closed circle” may have strengthened the liabilities accrued to SOEs and undermined their capacity to deal with environmental requirements. Hence, a double-layered “dissonant” environment stems from the opposition between the requirements of the EU environmental policy and the commitment of domestic economic and political elites to support the survival of energy SOEs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CEE; development politics; public enterprises; Romania; state institutions; Value of environment","15387216","","","2-s2.0-85098564616"

Meanwhile, the Karuk Tribe has always prioritized cultural burning as a vital spiritual and ecological practice, one that has been actively suppressed by the USFS. This article examines the discursive evolution of USFS fire science through the critical lens of settler colonial theory. A content analysis of agency discourse reveals how the USFS deployed anti-Indigenous rhetoric to justify its own unsubstantiated forest management agenda. USFS leadership racialized light burning by deridingly referring to it as ‘Piute Forestry.’ The agency has also discredited, downplayed, and erased Indigenous peoples and knowledges in ways that invoke tropes of the ‘Indian savage,’ the ‘Vanishing Indian,’ and the concept of ‘Terra Nullius.’ It wasn’t until the 1960s–in the context of the Civil Rights and American Indian Movements–that the USFS began contemplating the value of prescribed fire.

This is significant as beach litter continues to blight coastal environments and decreases visitor satisfaction. Increasingly, groups of individuals are voluntarily removing litter from the beach. Through the use of Grounded Theory Ethnography, this research was able to conceptually explain beach cleaning behaviour; thereby producing an original theory of “enviro-leisure activism.” After following groups of beach cleaners in Northern Ireland for 16 months and iteratively collecting and analysing data through participant observation and constant comparison analysis, it became evident that beach cleaning is a predominantly recreational activity, situated on the serious leisure spectrum with competing environmental and leisure motives. Beach cleaners inhabit social worlds bounded by legitimacy, identity and shared altruistic values. They exhibit low-level focused activism and a strong sense of place attachment. Story-telling and litter hunting emerged as mechanisms to cope with the perpetuity of the litter problem. Beach cleaning events could provide opportunities for tourism planners to promote inclusive, recreational family activities and attract new visitors to their local beach. Likewise, by engaging proactively with beach cleaning volunteers, environmental NGOs and policymakers could improve their own pro-environmental behaviour campaigns. © 2021 The Author(s).

Our approach investigates a smaller and more specific context – Copenhagen, Denmark – to unlock pathways that animate individuals to combat climate change in a city considered to be one of the world's greenest. Using a survey of approximately 1000 Copenhageners, we compare socio-demographic characteristics with attitudinal and belief profiles to see how each explanation predicts four pro-environmental behaviors. We find that attitudes and beliefs, especially with environmental concern and political ideology, tend to be more associated with pro-environmental behaviors compared to socio-demographic characteristics. We conclude by discussing how even in the context of a green capital, familiar pathways to pro-environmental actions are found. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Copenhagen, Denmark; Environmental consumption; Environmentally significant behavior; Pro-environmental behaviors; Urban sustainability","02642751","","","2-s2.0-85121421438"

Out of 150 employees, only 84 participated and had their responses collected by using convenience sampling. Smart PLS-SEM was used in analysing the relationships between the variables. The result of this study found that green lifestyles have a significant positive effect on pro-environmental behaviour. However, the impacts of environmental commitment, environmental consciousness, green self-efficacy, and green human resource management were insignificant. This study provides data that were developed using a cross-sectional design; the assessment of causality among the constructs was a risky process. Furthermore, the study collected data from a single source, namely the employees, which would enhance the relationships through common method bias. The findings of this study also offered several managerial implications for green organisations. © 2022 by the authors.

However, pollution is a problem of the health of environments, as much as it is a problem of the health of bodies. To understand health and pollution, it is necessary to examine energy-intensive infrastructures and developed environments that produce air pollutants and impair ecosystems. In other words, air pollution requires approaches to health that are planetary in scope and that account for the socio-environmental processes and relations that make health possible. Planetary health is often approached as a broad analysis of earth systems. However, diverse and situated environmental practices also contribute to the formation of planetary health. This article asks how citizen-sensing practices tune into the problem of air pollution in Southeast London, and in so doing differently configure pollution and planetary health. While many sensing technologies promise to make citizens into more capable political actors through the collection of data, this research investigates how communities use sensors in distinct ways to support, activate or extend community-led projects in urban environments. Rather than citizen-sensing practices contributing to improved air quality through the abstract circulation of data, we found that environmental monitoring became enmeshed in ongoing and broader struggles to improve the health of urban environments. These practices not only challenge the official scripts of sensing devices, they also remake the usual ways of demarcating health in relation to air pollution by shifting away from individual behaviour and toward collective environmental actions. This article then asks how community proposals for urban design and action conjoin with citizen-sensing practices to generate strategies for reworking and reconstituting health toward more planetary compositions. © 2020, The Author(s).","","26629992","","","2-s2.0-85089700727"

Diverse cultural groups in the Himalayan regions have their own local indigenous healthcare systems, with medicinal plant applications that differ depending on geography and ecology. Therefore, it is important to understand plant ecological behavior for prioritizing conservation efforts and comprehending the impact of climate change on plant phenological traits. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected through interviews and group discussions using semi-structured and close-ended questionnaires from different ethnic groups i.e., Gujjar, Bakarwal, and Kashmiri. The data was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and ordination techniques (Principal Component Analysis) using multivariate software. Results: The present investigation documented a total of 32 plant species belonging to 31 genera in 23 families. Across the 23 families, the distribution of species was unequal, half of the species belonged to just 6 families (Asteraceae, Berberidaceae, Lamiaceae, Ranunculaceae, Solanaceae and Amaranthaceae) while the remaining half belonged to 17 families. Amongst the parts of plants, roots were the most utilized plant part with 25% of usage followed by whole plant (22%). Gastro-intestinal disorders were treated with most species (18%), followed by pulmonary infections (13%). A heat map showed two distinctly separated clusters based on the degree of intensity of flowering timing of the flora and month. Based on the conservation assessment, out 19% of all species observed fell in the Critically Endangered category of IUCN, followed by 6% in the Vulnerable category. Conclusions: This study provides the ethnopharmacological and ecological scope of the plants of the Kashmir in the northern Himalaya. There is need to develop strategies to conserve and sustainably harvest these plants in order to maintain their long-term benefits in the medicinal field. © 2021, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

The findings challenge the common belief that millennials are more committed to being environmentally conscious, showing that many millennials do not feel responsible for their climate footprint, nor do they behave in a way that shows more concern than previous generations to improve their environmental performance.

In this paper, everyday life is offered as an example of one of these areas. We present practice theory as a tool to support the generation of alternative ways of theorising occupation. Practice theory is a collection of approaches that seek to understand the social world through patterns of activity. These approaches foreground activity and performance in the creation and perpetuation of all aspects of social life, providing a basic understanding that individuals create and re-create the means and conditions of their lives through actively engaging in and interacting with the environment. Practice theory can inform understandings of the person and their everyday occupations, embedded in social contexts. This approach offers a view of person and participation that is radically different from a structuralist perspective. The paper begins with a historical overview of how theories of occupation were developed within particular epistemologies. This is followed by an introduction to practice theory and discussion of what it can offer to the study of occupation.

Numerous studies have documented that young women farmers show high concern for environmentally friendly farming practices relative to young male farmers. However, family farms are still a prominent business form globally, and it is still unclear whether or not we can expect young women farmers in different employment statuses (manager, or full-time farm worker and spouse) and work schedules (full- or part-time) to show any differences in the adoption of environmental practices compared to young male farmers. This study investigates the question of how increasing the visibility of women on family farms, and young women's sensitivity to environmental concerns relative to male's, plays out in the dynamic of adopting Agri-Environment-Climate Measures (AECMs). Our results confirm gender differences in AECM adoption behavior when we investigate the employment statuses of young women farmers; however, for part-time family farms, gender differences in the adoption behavior disappears, while they emerge for environmental subsidies received. We argue that gender aspects of the adoption behavior of AECMs contain several overlapping issues, particularly gender differences in the spouse's involvement in farm work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-environment-climate measures (AECMs); Family farms; Part-time farms; Young farmers; Young women farm managers","07430167","","JRSTF","2-s2.0-85118705153"

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry. The paper demonstrates how companies in emerging economies can capture state regulations and how rendering environmental accountability becomes more of rhetoric than a reality with little impacts on the welfare of people and society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate environmental accountability; Corruption; Nigeria; Oil and gas and cement industry; Regulatory capture","20421168","","","2-s2.0-85090430421"

Through vignettes from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, a Baltic former Soviet republic, it critically examines the ideological work ecological imaginaries do to delegitimize socialism. Empirically I offer evidence on how local elites use the imaginaries of ecosystems and wastelands to “other” the Soviet-socialist past, and to justify a peculiar mix of neoliberal, pro-nationalistic and technoutopian policies. The article makes two contributions to the underexplored space between political ecology and postsocialist theory. First, the ecological imaginaries framework opens up possibilities for advancing a critical political ecology perspective beyond the realm of ostensibly environmental and environmentalist practices, and across a wider range of phenomena such as ecological nationalism, green gentrification and digital natures. Second, by drawing out the ways in which imaginaries allow elites and other social actors to neutralize socialist options in the present, I contribute to a rethinking of the concept of postsocialism by refocusing it on the ideological work of the notion that socialism belongs to the past. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Estonia; Imaginaries; Political ecology; Postsocialism; Tallinn","00167185","","","2-s2.0-85113351750"

The data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 1560 participants and physical observations in selected neighbourhoods in the study area. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, multiple regression and content analyses. It was observed that the most common UGI in the study area were parks, gardens, grasses, sport fields and street trees and that around 67% of the participants demonstrated good attitude towards UGI in their respective neighbourhoods. In addition, around 47% of the variance in R2 was explained by the regression model with residents’ perceived role of UGI in fostering social cohesion and health benefits and quality of neighbourhood UGI emerging as the top three factors that influenced residents’ attitude towards green infrastructure.

This paper asks why individuals adopt “self-sufficiency” based practices and finds that they respond to discomfort about being embedded in risk society by adopting self-sufficiency as an emotion management strategy that fits within an American cultural logic of individualism. Based on ethnographic methods including interviews and participant observation representing two sub-cultures of American self-sufficiency movements, I show that cultural narratives about risk generate uncomfortable emotions that must be managed, resulting in material changes to daily practice via emotion management strategies that embrace cultural individualism. Self-sufficiency allows participants to reconcile American individualism with the lived experience of dependence on untrustworthy institutions, that expose them to global, impersonal risks, thus alleviating discomfort and reinforcing cultural beliefs. The self-sufficiency practices homesteaders and preppers adopt result in changing relationships to the environment.

To preserve these resources, taboos and customary practices were instituted as precepts in precolonial Ghanaian societies to regulate access. However, recent studies claim that the proliferation of Western religions has significantly diminished the potency of these centuries-long belief systems, with a potential impact on the role of beliefs on behaviours. Applying conditional process modelling to survey data from four rural communities in Ghana, we explore whether some beliefs influence pro-environmental behaviours in relation to water resources pollution; and examine the potential factors that moderate this link. Results show that some belief factors predict pro-environmental behaviour. However, this link depends on gender and age. The present study thus advances our understanding of the complex ways in which beliefs interact with sociodemographic variables to influence the adoption of pro-environmental behaviours. © 2020 Newcastle University.","beliefs; conditional process modelling; Ghana; pro-environmental behaviour; water resources management","09640568","","","2-s2.0-85084291692"

We find that pessimistic respondents are more likely to participate in pro-environmental behaviors. The media use and evaluation of the environmental performance of the local government significantly stimulate pro-environmental participation. The results reveal that knowledge and concern about the environment can mitigate the negative effect of optimistic bias on pro-environmental behaviors. In regions where environmental information is widely available, environmental pessimists are especially more likely to participate in such activities.

Consequently, there are a growing number of private agri-environmental schemes (AES) now operating alongside public AES that offer farmers economic rewards to maintain and enhance the environment. This study focused exclusively on a small number of commercial dairy producers located in the North West of England who were all suppliers of a global food producer and members of the producer's own private AES. The study explored the economic and societal drivers of adoption of agri-environmental behaviours and perceptions of the private processor AES. The study adopted a mixed-method approach. In Stage 1 a structured questionnaire was used to explore the role of an AES offered by the global food processor in the financial stability and environmental sustainability of dairy farms (n = 20). The survey sought to understand the range of interventions adopted, explore future adoption intentions and identify possible ways in which AESs could be extended. The results from the questionnaire were explored further in Stage 2, through qualitative in-depth interviews (n = 12). A thematic analysis approach was taken to describe the key themes that motivated farmer engagement in agri-environmental schemes. Overall, farmers felt that income from the private AES provided stability and resilience to their businesses, permitting them to have greater confidence in business planning and budgeting for the upcoming year. The majority of the farmers were not part of a public AES, but were already undertaking some agri-environmental behaviours and were motivated to join the private scheme primarily by financial incentives and by a desire to maintain the natural environment. A minority of respondents identified that the financial incentives offered had directly motivated a behaviour change. Decisions over which agri-environmental behaviours to adopt were driven by the existing animal management practices, geography and landscape of the farm. Farmers compared the private scheme favourably to available public AESs, which they perceived as more restrictive and providing insufficient reward for the “red tape” involved. In contrast, private scheme membership was perceived to have been beneficial for both their farm business and the local environment, and many reported personal satisfaction from engagement in agri-environmental behaviours. It is important that the design of future public AES does not “crowd out” private schemes, giving farmers increasing AES choice and increasing the overall amount of funding available for the delivery of public goods from agriculture. © 2020 The Authors","Agri-environment scheme; Dairy farming; Environmental land management; Mixed-methods; Resilience","02648377","","","2-s2.0-85096506793"

This research was aimed at determining the associations between environmental beliefs and sustainable behavior in a group of inhabitants of southern Colombia. The methodology was exploratory and cross-sectional, with descriptive and correlational analyses. The sample was made up of 368 people from two regions in southern Colombia (57.5% female and 42.5% male); their ages ranged between 18 and 69 years (X = 19.36; SD = 8.59). Information was collected with questionnaires that measured climate change risk perception, environmental beliefs, and sustainable behavior. The results show higher scores for equitable behavior and environmental beliefs. Environmental beliefs—egobiocentrism—and risk perception of climate change predict both sustainable and pro-ecological behavior, as well as altruistic, frugal, and equitable behavior. It is concluded that the presence of environmental beliefs, along with information regarding a sense of environmental deterioration, climate change and the consequences for the future, can predict the implementation of actions for sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

This phenomenon can be attributed primarily to altering lifestyle, consumption, and portability patterns. Even though there is a significant applicability, understanding the factors determining the pro-environmental behavior (PEB) of university employees is lacking. Thus, this study extended the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explain PEB among university employees. Ten hypotheses were suggested regarding the relations between the initial TPB constructs, environmental ethics, and emotional intelligence. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data from a randomly selected sample of 302 university employees from six Malaysian higher educational institutions listed in the UI Green Matrix 2016. The findings revealed that environmental ethics significantly affected attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms. Furthermore, pro-environmental behavioral intentions (PEIs) were directly influenced by attitude and perceived behavioral control, while emotional intelligence mediated the relationship between PEIs and PEB. Moving forward, this study will provide new insights into the literature of university employees’ PEB using an expanded TPB model. © 2021 by the authors.

There is a strong urge to go beyond theoretical ABMs with behavioral theories setting stylized rules that guide agents’ actions, especially when it concerns policy-related simulations. However, it remains unclear to what extent theory-driven ABMs mislead, if at all, a choice of a policy when compared to the outcomes of models with empirical micro-foundations. This is especially relevant for pro-environmental policies that increasingly rely on quantifying cumulative effects of individual behavioral changes, where ABMs are so helpful. We propose a comparison framework to address this methodological dilemma, which quantitatively explores the gap in predictions between theory-and data-driven ABMs. Inspired by the existing theory-driven model, ORVin-T, which studies the individual choice between organic and conventional products, we design a survey to collect data on individual preferences and purchasing decisions. We then use this extensive empirical microdata to build an empirical twin, ORVin-E, replacing the theoretical assumptions and secondary aggregated data used to parametrize agents’ decision strategies with our empirical survey data. We compare the models in terms of key outputs, perform sensitivity analysis, and explore three policy scenarios. We observe that the theory-driven model predicts the shifts to organic consumption as accurately as the ABM with empirical micro-foundations at both aggregated and individual scales. There are slight differences (±5%) between the estimations of the two models with regard to different behavioral change scenarios: increasing conventional tax, launching organic social-informational campaigns, and their combination. Our findings highlight the goodness of fit and usefulness of theoretical modeling efforts, at least in the case of incremental behavioral change. It sheds light on the conditions when theory-driven and data-driven models are aligned and on the value of empirical data for studying systemic changes. © 2021, University of Surrey.

We inductively analyzed climate change beliefs and perceptions into five themes. Common themes included uncertainty and attribution skepticism (i.e., attribution of climate change to natural cycles only). Past experience and personal observation strongly shaped climate beliefs, but in diverse ways. We examine links between producers’ climate change views and their adaptive and mitigative practices. Climate change belief did not appear to influence farmers’ environmental practices, which are motivated by economic and environmental factors. Although past experience encourages adaptation, beliefs about natural climate cycles—and the limitations of even intergenerational memory of past extremes—may ultimately reduce preparedness for the unexpected “extreme extremes” of the future. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; belief; climate change; cycles; farmer; skepticism","08941920","","","2-s2.0-85092188100"

Dissimilar others are people who differ from the person in question (e.g., in terms of lifestyle or culture). While most research focuses on homogenous social networks (e.g., spatial communities), we explore the potential of network heterophily. Specifically, using data (n = 1370) from the Flemish Survey on Sociocultural Shifts, we examine the relationship between network heterophily and pro-environmental behavior (i.e., shopping decisions and curtailment behavior). Building on Granovetter’s study on ‘the strength of weak ties’, we emphasize the importance of social ties that provide novel information and social expectations. Through interaction with dissimilar others, people may create a heterogeneous network in which a diversity of information and social expectations with regard to pro-environmental behavior circulates. We expect that network heterophily may foster pro-environmental behavior. Our findings indicate that pro-environmental behavior may indeed be positively related to interaction with dissimilar others, partly because people with many dissimilar ties know more about environmental problems and are more concerned about them. This study therefore shows that network heterophily promotes pro-environmental behavior.

Acting damaging environmental behaviours by governments and citizens in some societies, specifically in neoliberal societies, have been increased. Governments in these societies, to guarantee the profits of capitalism, may normalise the damaging behaviours. One of the results of this process is the violating of right on the safe environment. One of the fields which consider the effects of the culture-building of the damaging environmental behaviours, is the green cultural criminology as one of the branches of the critical criminology. The aforementioned criminology by merging cultural and green criminology has taken important steps in green studies. This research, using a descriptive-analysis method, has come to this conclusion that the medium which is at the disposal of the capitalism, by prescribing the consumer culture and the fashionism, have a very important role in the extension of these kinds of damaging behaviours. They play this process by environmental immorality. As a result, on the one hand, the green culture building and environmental teachings should be institutionalised on the citizens.

Increasingly, private households can be observed to take up different renewable energy technologies; however, the introduction of these technologies is not accompanied by a broader adoption of pro-environmental behaviors, as recent studies have shown. At the same time, group settings and social capital seem to promote the uptake of wide-ranging sustainability measures. Six case studies were conducted among different sustainable community projects in Germany to shed light on why and how broad sustainability transformation in such settings comes about. Findings suggest that successful implementation of wide-ranging sustainable measures and changes in behaviors in community settings result from motivations that originate from an interplay of social needs, social capital, social norms, and environmental concern. Strong environmental attitudes, not among all, but a critical mass of members and key individuals are necessary. The desire for community and other motives, along with social influence and social norms push individuals with low environmental concern to participate in sustainable endeavors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy transition; Motives; Pro-environmental behavior; Social norms; Spillover effects; Sustainability","22146296","","","2-s2.0-85109567562"

While the presence of the TPG is well established, we have yet to fully implement mechanisms for overcoming its challenges. Thus, our goal is to characterize the TPG and identify practical recommendations for minimizing it. Here, a diverse group of experts in the environmental realm (spanning landscape planning, conservation science, environmental sociology, resource management, political science, and anthropology, among others) present our perspectives on the TPG. More specifically, we share an organized framework for understanding the TPG and suggest recommendations that can help make progress in one or more dimension(s). Conceptual topics discussed are the implications of the gap and its persis-tence. Organizational/institutional topics include the implications of the overabundance, inaccessibility, and uncertainty of scientific information, and a need for mainstreaming boundary spanning activities. Lastly, cultural topics include differences in culture and epistemologies across knowledge generators and users, shifting cultures through co-production, and changes in educational curricula. Recommendations for minimizing the TPG include conceptually recasting what is considered ‘success,’ institutional reform, enhanced information delivery, leveraging knowledge brokers and boundary organizations, leveraging ‘champions’ in policy, using co-production and/or integrative research, confronting the contemporary ‘fake news’ phenomenon, and rethinking researcher and practitioner training and development. By sharing our framework and recom-mendations, we provide insight, as well as a starting point for those looking to narrow the TPG and improve knowledge generator-user relationships. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Co-production; Environmental practice; Knowledge mobilization; Knowledge-action gap; Science policy","25245279","","","2-s2.0-85115397398"

While previous research has documented intergenerational transmission (IGT) of environmental attitudes and behaviors, what is not known is whether individuals exhibit similar motivations for engaging in these behaviors. We posit that differences in motivations may exist because generations face different economic and social contexts at different ages; even though environmental behaviors may persist; each generation may frame differently why they engage in those behaviors. We develop this argument while relying on the empty-belly/full-stomach thesis. The distinction between the intergenerational transmission of behaviors and motivations provides insights on how best to target policies for behavioral change. Using survey data from a national sample of 517 parent-child dyads, we rely on dyad and cohort analysis to ask if generational differences exist in framing the motivations for environmental behaviors. To further explore how motivations are shaped, we study their association with external sources of influence including media, social networks, and parents’ influence. Our findings suggest that while there are similarities of environmental behaviors among parents and children, children were less likely to be driven by environmental motivations and more likely to name economic and habit and family pressure motivations. We term this an environmental disenchantment because environmental motivations are less likely to promote environmental behaviors across generations in South Korea. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Intergenerational transmission; Motivations; Pro-environmental behaviors; South Korea","00167185","","","2-s2.0-85102085592"

Climate change and related issues associated with the interaction of humans with the environment are of great importance in today’s context, hence, it is equally important to test such a relationship in a non-industrial context. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the relationship between CSR and pro-environmental behavior of students (SPEB) in the higher education sector of Pakistan. Given that university students are more inclined to act pro-environmentally, as they partake in different climate change activities and are part of the debate on the global environmental crisis, considering this sector to promote SPEB is of the utmost importance. The current study also proposes emotional affinity towards students (EATN) as a mediator between the proposed relationship. The current study data were collected from university students (n = 656) studying in different universities of Pakistan. The results were validated by employing the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results confirmed that there exists a positive association between CSR perception of a university and SPEB, and EATN partially mediates this relationship. The findings of the current study will be helpful to the higher education policymakers in Pakistan to mitigate the country’s environmental footprint by promoting the sustainable behavior of students as an outcome of CSR. Moreover, these findings will also be helpful to the academia for policymaking pertinent to educational governance. © 2021 by the authors.

In today’s technological age, audiences are prone to watching performance on their smart devices. This live-disconnect between the audience and performer/performance has affected the industry on multiple levels. The live connection between the performer and the audience was previously a primary motivator to enhance the continuation of the art but this is not the case now. Since 1970 when performers such as Trisha Brown (Rosenberg, 2017) began to move performance into the public space, the idea of the typical proscenium stage lost its dominance and highlighted the need for investigation into alternative means of reaching audiences. One of the ways we (as performing artists) are acknowledging this void in practice pedagogy is studying how site performance engages with different environments, practices and social/cultural systems.

In this specific case study, a set of values – equality and autonomy – central to the Ngaju people, the indigenous population in Central Kalimantan, become contested in the course of the climate change mitigation project. These central values are produced in everyday activities that include mobility and the productive base – subsistence and market-based production – among the Ngaju people. On the other hand, the climate change mitigation project-related environmental practices and actions produce values that point to individual (material) benefit and stratification of the society.

It draws on qualitative focus group data collected from a sample of Chinese people who had studied in the UK and since returned to China. The findings show that living in the UK led to spillover of some pro-environmental behaviours, but most of these changes were not sustained upon return to China. Employing a framework from social practice, the findings show that the desire to ‘fit in’ with the social norms of a host country are powerful in creating change, without requiring normative engagement with sustainability. However, the findings also suggest that behavioural change will not endure after short-term migration without supportive social norms and where there are barriers to pro-environmental behaviours in the home country. The paper highlights what those specific barriers might be in contemporary China, with reference to cultural traditions of ‘mianzi’ and ‘guanxi’, government discourses which do not prioritise individual agency, and an absence of post-materialist values. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behaviour Change; China; Migration; Social Practice; Spillover","23251042","","","2-s2.0-85098598094"

This tension is at the heart of everyday life in Ludigaun, a Bahun (high caste Hindu) village in West Nepal. Utilising a framework of a local familiar tension between ‘traditional’ ideas/practices and those imagined through ‘modernity’, I draw on ethnographic material describing a year-long family conflict over keeping buffalo, to allow the tension and contradictions inherent in village life – of gender, generations, and caste – and their articulation with national and global relations – to come into focus. For an older generation of women, their work and relationships with buffalo are at stake, presenting an uncertain future and a possible crisis of identity and of place. I argue that the relationship between these women and their buffalo extends beyond material needs and is a crucial emotional attachment; it is an intimate ‘mode of care’ that is integral to village social reproduction. Women's work with buffalo (although it has no positive status of its own) demonstrates the older generation of women are not passive but active players in constituting caste, gendered and social status identities. Keeping buffalo is fundamental to the ways in which and older generation of Bahun women exert their influence. Building on the work of Campbell (Animals in Person: Cultural Perspectives on Human–Animal Intimacies, 2005b, pp. 79–100; Living Between Juniper and Palm: Nature, Culture and Power in the Himalayas, 2013), Tsing (The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins, 2015), Harraway (Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene, 2016) and Govindrajan (Animal Intimacies: Interspecies Relatedness in India’s Central Himalayas, 2018), the human–buffalo relationship presented here demonstrates the human–animal relationship as a key relationship of value to Bahun women at a time when the out-migration phenomenon has taken their children away. I argue that in this way, and at a time when human–environment relationships are increasingly disembedded, human–buffalo relationships in West Nepal emphasise a unity between humans and their environment and remind us that intimacy and becoming are multispecies affairs. © 2021 Australian Anthropological Society","gender; human–environment; multispecies; Nepal; out-migration","10358811","","","2-s2.0-85119329620"

Here, we studied an incentive-based program for forest conservation in Bolivia – called “Reciprocal Watershared Agreements” – that mixes material compensations with pro-social and pro-environmental motivations as a way to reduce crowding-out of intrinsic motivations and to increase participation. Based on a sample of 470 households who were offered the program, we studied household characteristics that influenced (i) the probability of participation in the program, (ii) the intensity of the participation, measured as the area allocated in the agreement, and (iii) the modality of participation, measured as the probability of participation in the different types of agreements. We found that owning property titles, having large forested land with low conservation opportunity cost, agricultural equipment and off-farm incomes seem to favour participation. In addition, the probability of participation increases with some pro-social factors, such as a deeper or older integration into social networks, and greater compliance to social norms of reciprocity. We also found that a lack of trust in public institutions can increase both the likelihood and the intensity of participation, as can certain pro-environmental factors, such as awareness of environmental problems, knowledge about potential solutions to solve them and perception of the gains associated with the conservation of ecosystem services. Finally, we found that feeling some individual responsibility for environmental issues and some difficulty in performing pro-environmental options may increase participation into more restrictive agreements. Our results thus highlight the factors that could increase uptake and factors on which programs might focus in order to have a greater impact on pro-environmental behaviours. They also suggest that incentive-based program can be designed to take advantage of pro-social and pro-environmental motivations as strongly as of economic ones. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bolivia; Forest conservation; Incentive-based conservation program; Motivations; Participation; South America","0305750X","","","2-s2.0-85106964057"

Addressing increased environmental problems requires better understanding of the relations between focused and explicit environmental education, environmental responsibility, and religious values. The current study examined the relationship between environmental education and ecologically friendly behavior, utilizing insights from resource conservation theory. The relationship between the variables mentioned above was examined to determine the mediating effect of environmental responsibility and the moderating effect of Islamic values. Through a cross-sectional approach, data were gathered from 413 university students. The data were analyzed using analytical techniques such as “structural equation modeling” and “PROCESS.” The study’s findings support the predicted conceptual model, indicating that environmental education was positively related to environmentally friendly behavior. Furthermore, environmental responsibility partially mediated the relationship above, whereas Islamic values positively moderated the relationships between environmental education and ecologically friendly behavior as well as between environmental education and environmental responsibility.

In the hotel sector, guests’ good water consumption habits result in greater conservation, leading to more efficient sustainable management of the resource. Sociodemographic profile has been identified as a key factor in explaining the frequency of guests’ displaying good water consumption habits in hotels. However, variables related to guest stay could also be fundamental in predicting guests’ environmental behaviour. Data were collected from 648 surveys administered to guests at a hotel that excels with its good practices in water consumption and management. A generalized linear model with common sociodemographic variables and two stay characteristics variables (length of stay and loyalty) were applied to predict guests’ water conservation habits.

In this sense, guests who stay longer at the hotel tend to display greater water conservation habits.

In both cases, the goal is to achieve environmental sustainability, but with different precepts and principles applied within different perspectives: global vs. local sustainability, individual feelings vs. social pressures as determinants of pro-environmental behavior, and long-run vs. short-run sustainability. Analytical results (feasibility) showed that REL are overall more feasible than SEC and, specifically, REL are more likely to affect the many pro-environmental behaviors required to achieve global sustainability, whereas SEC to affect some pro-environmental behaviors required to achieve local sustainability; REL are more likely to affect pro-environmental behaviors based on individual feelings and social pressures from small communities, whereas SEC to affect pro-environmental behaviors based on social pressures from large communities; REL are more likely to solve collective-action problems to achieve short-run sustainability, whereas SEC to solve collective-action problems to achieve long-run sustainability. Statistical results (reliability) based on 32 random- and between-effects regressions support these results and, particularly, REL and SEC were complementary in time (e.g., for REL, short-run sustainability is more reliable than long-run sustainability; for SEC, long-run sustainability is more reliable than short-run sustainability), in space (e.g., for SEC, local sustainability is more reliable than global sustainability), and in society (e.g., for REL, individual feelings are more reliable than social pressures). © 2021, The Author(s).","","26629992","","","2-s2.0-85106317306"

Securing access to land and the rights to access natural resources are the tenets of self-sufficiency. Preppers associate access to land, water, resources, and distance from the presumed danger of the urban core with the national myth of a white, settler-colonial rural idyll. Rural living is thus an ideal of self-sufficiency. Based on thematic narrative analysis of data derived from multi-method ethnographic research (participant observation, digital ethnography, and interviews [n = 22]), I examine the relationship between settler-colonialism, white hegemony, and environmental privilege in preppers' discourse about the rural. Preppers rely on racially based frameworks that align with hegemonic whiteness, color-blind racism, and settler-colonialism. Even as they deny the salience of structural racism, preppers make claims to superiority based on cultural capacities like individualism, meritocracy, rationality, and objectivity. They invoke these claims to justify individualized, defensive response to socio-environmental risk that reproduces white possession of rural lands. Racialized prepper discourse informs the environmental practices that preppers adopt, based on claims to superiority and cultural entitlement to land rooted in settler-colonial ethics. © 2021 by the Rural Sociological Society","","00360112","","","2-s2.0-85115736333"

We assess the importance of intrinsic motivation as a dominant factor and show how differing levels of intrinsic motivation influence the effectiveness of external conditions, such as monetary incentives and green infrastructures.

The human ability to define oneself as a member of a group (social identity) may represent a powerful source for realizing environmental endeavors. Therefore, in this article we conceptualize precycling behavior in households as pro-environmental behavior embedded in social identity processes. To explore precycling, we combined food diaries and qualitative virtual interviews with 26 households in Berlin, Germany. We analyzed our data based on the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA). Starting from the behavioral element of the model (response), we substantiate the concept of precycling suggesting that it can be distinguished into six types of behavior. Furthermore, we propose that the enactment of these precycling behaviors is shaped by social identity processes and social influence in different groups, including: the household itself, neighbors, family and friends, or food collectives. We conclude that these processes are important to realizing precycling in small and private groups as well as in larger collectives. Implications are derived for empirical research and theoretical development as well as for public programs and intervention studies. © 2021 by the authors.

A key driver behind this recurrence of interest has been a growing concern over the lack of child exposure to outdoor experiences and with the natural world and their ensuing nature-deficit disorder. This article considers Forest School as linked with the concept of nature connection that is the sensation of belonging to a wider natural community. This sense of belonging developed by being in nature can also be a key factor in promoting attachment and sense of place which in turn is associated with the promotion of health, wellbeing and pro-environmental behaviours. As such the origins towards achieving nature connection are a formal part of the Forest School Association’s (FSA 2016). Forest School principals, with growing research linking Forest School and nature connection as concomitant. Recent work has suggested that contact, emotion, meaning, compassion, and beauty are key pathways for the formation of nature connection and there is a strong need to better understand children’s nature connection in this context. Further, from the premise that what goes on in spaces and places is fundamentally linked to both social and spatial processes, this article also attempts to understand the spatialities of Forest School in order to frame the development of nature connection within a socio-spatial analytic. © 2021, Crown.","Forest school; Nature connection; Pathways; Sense of place; Space","22063110","","","2-s2.0-85101083183"

The findings suggest that through regular and repeated activities in a natural setting at forest school, children become more relaxed, overcome any fears, have fun, connect with nature as they come to know it better, and develop an affinity for the location. Further, they develop a sense of ownership and concern for the forest school setting and desire to protect it.

The focus of this paper is the National Tourism Policy (NTP) for Malawi and how central and local government structures enforce it to promote environmental sustainability practices in hotels. The paper uses a Case Study approach whereby the Sogecoa Golden Peacock Hotel and the Sunbird Mount Soche Hotel are used to explore how the NTP has ensured sustainable environmental practices are followed. A qualitative research method was used through semi-structured interviews to secure the perceptions of key informants. Through a Grounded Theory analysis, the findings revealed that the NTP does not facilitate the enforcement of sustainable environmental practices. Furthermore, because of this shortfall in the NTP, hotels do not have an environmental management policy to promote sustainable environmental practices. This paper, therefore, recommends an urgent need to revise the NTP and introduce sustainable environmental management guidelines in order for the hotel sector to emulate. It is further recommended that hotel managers should have a thorough understanding of environmental sustainability to ensure that the industry addresses negative environmental impacts.

Extant research on business sustainability has acknowledged the relevance of sustainability concerns for business strategy and organizing. Yet, dominant conceptualizations of business sustainability remain focused on the organization and its business case, in the quest to find strategies that translate less harmful social and environmental practices into competitive advantages. Only few scholars have gone beyond such a commercial logic and adopted a systems approach to derive business strategies from the logic of social-ecological systems. In this article, we propose that taking a systems approach means to conceptualize business sustainability in terms of regenerative business, that is, businesses that enhance, and thrive through, the health of social-ecological systems in a co-evolutionary process. As our main contribution, we develop the restore-preserve-enhance scale for regenerative business strategies reflecting a continuum of strategies for regeneration. These strategies follow from two main principles and related criteria for a systems-based level of aspiration and an adaptive management approach to regeneration. By doing so, we fundamentally shift the focus away from a business logic to a systems logic. Importantly, we offer concrete strategies for organizations to contribute to life-supporting conditions in social-ecological systems. © The Author(s) 2020.","Business sustainability; regeneration; social-ecological systems; strategy; systems thinking","14761270","","","2-s2.0-85097607534"

Results indicate that anthropocentric view coupled with nature’s position as an alienated entity is extensively embeded in the textbooks. Actors who are culprits of environmental problems were not addressed in a way pupils can easily identify. Besides, the proposed actions were not specifically designed to provide pupils the opportunity to partake in environmental protection activities. We critically discussed the implications of these representations and urged for reformed textbooks in Ethiopia.

As one of the largest cities in Europe, London is a pertinent site to explore the challenges and possibilities of future food systems. The apple is used as a lens to explore the diverging urban political ecologies of corporate-led and community-led food systems. A mixed method qualitative research approach combines a series of semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in producing, distributing and trading apples with practice-based ethnographic fieldwork, responding to calls within urban political ecology for more situated and grounded approaches that build new understandings of socio-environmental practices. Research shows diverging practices and biophysical properties of the apple amongst producers supplying multiple retailers and those operating via a community-led trading mechanism, which includes a farmers’ market and fruit and veg box scheme. Fieldwork suggests apple production for multiple retailers is retail-led, placing increasing pressures upon producers. Biophysical properties of the corporate-led apple are becoming increasingly standardised; narrow in terms of varietal range, and; privatised, via the rise of club brand apples. In contrast, fieldwork suggests community-led trade is based upon producer-led, agroecological approaches to production, distribution and trade. Biophysical properties of the community-led apple are context-dependent and diverse in terms of varietal range, quality and size. Community-led trading is identified as a mechanism for scaling agroecology through cultivating community social and ecological relations and producer-led approaches. To become more than marginal, agroecology and community-led trade require enabling policy, planning and legislative frameworks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agroecology; Apple; city region; practice; urban political ecology","13549839","","","2-s2.0-85101627674"

This concern–behavior gap is often explained by the public goods character of climate change mitigation, which is associated with a high individual incentive to take a free ride when possible. This paper examines cooperation beliefs and their impact on individuals’ energy conservation behavior. Analyzing data from the European Social Survey, it appears that cooperation beliefs are rather low in Europe and that most people do not expect others to limit their energy use to help mitigate climate change. This low trust contrasts with individuals’ reported level of energy conservation behavior and the general high level of energy conservation in most European countries. This trust gap has important implications for pro-environmental behavior as high trust in others’ pro-environmental behavior fosters individuals’ attempts to save energy. © 2021 by the author.

To test our predictions, we apply a generalized structural equation modelling technique to a household survey dataset collected from the Singapore private housing market. We find that green building residents have a higher assessment of their residential environment. This increases the level of their residential satisfaction, which subsequently enhances their quality of life and reduces their intention to move. We demonstrate that green buildings provide a supportive and educational environment for motivating and educating their residents to behave in a pro-environmental manner. Residents' improved pro-environmental behavior and enhanced well-being are attributed to some, though not all, green features. We find that tangible green features (i.e., greenery, ventilation, indoor environments, and waste facilities) have greater impacts on residents than intangible ones (i.e., energy efficiency and accessibility to public transport). The findings contribute ideas and solutions to the future development of green buildings by taking a social perspective to pursue urban sustainability.

Environmental health advocates, scientists, and consulting firms are stepping in to provide designers with new tools—including science-based assessment methods, standards, databases, and software—intended to help structure and inform decision-making in sustainable design. We argue that green design tools play an important but largely uninvestigated role in giving designers new forms of influence while mediating how designers’ values are translated into actual design choices. Tool makers embed their own values and politics into the construction of the tools, which function as “black boxes”—their internal operations are understood as less important than their outputs for informing sustainable design. Using the green building movement as a case study, we consider three tools for selecting environmentally benign materials: the GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals, Pharos, and the Health Product Declaration. Examining controversies about the scientific validity of green design tools, we suggest that they are rooted in value conflicts and tensions in the politics of chemical knowledge. Transparent engagement with values and politics among tool developers and users could strengthen the legitimacy and credibility of green design tools. © The Author(s) 2020.","chemicals; design; engagement; environmental practices; governance; intervention; politics; power","01622439","","","2-s2.0-85097104739"

In order to provide a broader and novel picture of the phenomenon, this study extends the widely used Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model in several ways, through a large survey of Italian consumers. First, three dimensions of green purchase behaviour are considered, namely, the willingness to pay a premium price, the green purchase frequency and the green purchase satisfaction. Second, several antecedents are considered simultaneously. Third, new (consumer creativity) or so far marginally studied (materialism and green practices) antecedents are included. Fourth, the mediating roles of green purchase satisfaction and willingness to pay a premium price in the link between the considered antecedents and the frequency of green purchase are investigated. Results show that the three dimensions of green purchase behaviour have different antecedents, so highlighting that green purchase behaviour is a multi-faceted phenomenon that should not be studied as a single general concept. Personal norms and value for money emerged to be very relevant predictors. The significant effects of creativity, materialism and green practices provide evidence that extending the TPB model with these three antecedents is useful to more deeply understand green purchase behaviour. Green purchase satisfaction is the strongest predictor of purchase frequency and mediates the effects of personal norms and value for money. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","environmental sustainability; green consumer behaviour; green consumers; green products; green purchase behaviour; pro-environmental behaviour; sustainable consumption; Theory of Planned Behaviour","09644733","","","2-s2.0-85102363557"

There is a distinct lack of research on the process of exhibition influencing people’s behavioral intentions. Based on the belief–emotion–norm theoretical model, this study integrates environmental beliefs, exhibition attachment, and an audience’s environmental behavior intentions into a research model to explain how the exhibition affects the audience.

The study’s findings suggest that audiences’ environmental beliefs may have a significant and positive impact on their attachment to environmentally themed exhibitions as well as their environmental behavioral intentions. This study also confirmed that attachment to exhibitions, a temporary space, can play an important mediating role between environmental beliefs and intentions to engage in pro-environmental behavior. The exhibition dependency, in particular, acts as a mediator between environmental beliefs and pro-environmental behavior intentions. Although the mediating effect of exhibition identity is insignificant, exhibition dependence–exhibition identity as a whole has a partial mediating effect in the process of influencing exhibition audiences’ environmental behavior.

However, these often only have temporary water conservation effects. A promising development in this regard is Digital Water Meters (DWM), which can provide near real-time water-use feedback. Despite extensive DWM experience in some water-stressed regions, a profound understanding of the initial attitude towards DWM and message-tailoring opportunities are rarely empirically explored. This study aims to obtain insights into the attitude towards the introduction of DWM and explore opportunities for message tailoring, a topic of extra relevance as we may be on the threshold of a large-scale DWM implementation in many world regions. Messages tailored to (i) normative beliefs and attitudes on drinking water, (ii) water-use activity and (iii) phase of decision-making, seem particularly compatible with DWM. Through a survey (n = 1037) in the Netherlands, we observe that 93% of respondents have no objections if their utility invests in DWM and that 78% would accept a (free) DWM because of improved leakage detection, lower costs and environmental considerations. Finally, instead of sociodemographic factors, we observe that an attitude-based customer segmentation approach is an especially useful predictor of respondent’s motivation to endorse DWM and forms a promising basis for water conservation message-tailoring strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, we depart from the predominately quantitative-orientated SEPs literature by conducting in-depth interviews and analysis of owners and managers of SMEs in the United Kingdom within a legitimacy theoretical framework. Our findings from a comprehensive number of interviewees show that SMEs employ a complex mix of both symbolic and substantive SEPs with the aim of enhancing the legitimacy and sustainability of their operations. The results emphasise the strengths of social engagement, reputation and image, environmental embeddedness, industry differentiation and education facilitators. In particular, the paper shows that legitimating strategies can have a dual purpose of being symbolic in nature but also inferring a substantive legitimacy claim.

An example is the National Housing Monitoring Network (Red Nacional de Monitoreo, ReNaM). By installing networked sensors in homes in different cities in Chile, ReNaM seeks to generate a large public database on the environmental behaviour of homes in real life conditions and throughout their life cycle, in order to make data-driven policies and regulations on sustainable building. In this article, we argue that experiments with digital innovations like ReNaM are moving towards a ‘sensor governmentality’ or a mode of sensitive regulation of household behaviour at a distance, recomposing the relationship that the State establishes with its population. However, we find that this sensor governmentality is multivalent, fragile and friction-loaded. We analyse different scripts present in ReNaM and the frictions that emerge between divergent ways of materialising this sensor network from above and below. Moreover, the real environmental conditions and behaviours that the experiment seeks to capture through sensors are always challenged by the multiple entanglements that sensor devices unfold in domestic spaces, suggesting that affective and collective possibilities in these real-world experiments should be considered. © 2021 Process Press.","citizen sensing; data-driven decisions; domestic appropriation; Real-world experiment; speculative sensing","09505431","","","2-s2.0-85102708162"

The objectives were to investigate the relationship among the proposed constructs as well as to examine the mediating role of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control (PBC) on the relationship between EC and its dimensions and intention to adopt green concepts. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among developer organisations in Klang Valley and the key target respondents were project managers. This study devoted priority to quantitative approach with complementary qualitative data to elaborate on the statistical results. In total, 87 usable questionnaires were returned, representing a response rate of 24.5 per cent. In addition, face-to-face interviews were carried out to gather information to complement quantitative findings. Findings: Mediation results suggested PBC to be a significant mediator for the relationship between EC, human over nature and eco-crisis and behavioural intention. In the model between eco-crisis facet and behavioural intention, apart from PBC, attitude was found to be another significant mediator of the relationship. Interview with informants revealed that most believed human activities are causing detrimental harm to the environment. With this concern, they are confident about their organisations’ ability to deliver more green projects in the future. Originality/value: The use of specific dimension of EC and the integration of EC and its dimensions within the TPB has provided new insights to expedite the transition to sustainable construction. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Developer organizations; Environmental concern; New ecological paradigm; Pro-environmental behaviour; Sustainable construction; Theory of planned behaviour","20466099","","","2-s2.0-85075070401"

We contribute to social practice theory by drawing attention to the interplay of environmental perceptions and neighbourhood inhabitation as factors that facilitate changing environmental practices.

We selected 187 respondents from clothing industry through a self-administered questionnaire survey in Chattogram, the commercial capital of Bangladesh. Findings: The outcomes revealed that both SRHRM and EL influence VEB. However, the moderation analysis indicated that EL negatively intervenes in the effect of SRHRM on VEB.

Drawing on interviews and ethnographic work in smallholder maize farms in South Africa, we introduce the concept of ecological deskilling in agriculture and describe three dimensions related to it: loss of ecologically based practices, loss of relational knowledge, and loss of socio-ecological agency. Our findings suggest that the introduction of modern seed varieties may contribute to the process of ecological deskilling due to the disruption of the co-evolution of knowledge between smallholder farmers and agroecological environments. We argue that this form of deskilling can undermine food sovereignty and farmers’ agency. It can also narrow future possibilities and pathways for sustainable agricultural development. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","agrarian modernization; Biotechnology; deskilling; gmos; maize; smallholder farmers; socio-ecological","21683565","","","2-s2.0-85101643788"

However, existent studies show conflicting results on politically connected firms’ CSR participation. We examine the relationship between political endorsement and firms’ engagement in different types of CSR simultaneously. Using a representative sample of more than 1,000 private firms in the early 2000s, we find that politically endorsed firms engage more in philanthropic donation, but less in environmental practices, which impose higher costs and constraints than philanthropy.

Unlike a traditional approach to heritage generally limited to considering only the visible values of the place, this research stands on the belief that, in the context of heritage, the implementation and application of behavioral knowledge in architectural discourse contributes to the intensification and enhancement of these relations. In accordance with the need to re-examine existing and explore new forms of the relationship between future life of heritage and social wellbeing, the main goal of the research is to examine the possibility of improving this relationship through a value-based architectural programming methodological framework. This paper was conducted through: (1) theoretical framework that intertwines environment–behavior theories and architectural programming as the value-matrix methodology for the reuse of heritage; (2) exploring the established framework through design results gathered within the design-based studio on “heritage reprogramming” at the University of Belgrade—Faculty of Architecture with a particular focus on the modernist architectural heritage; and (3) discussing the overall principles through the multiscale and value-based approach. The evaluation of the results indicates the possibility of improving the social dimension of heritage protection and reuse, as well as the need to shift the focus from exclusively material and formal values of heritage to social and cultural aspects in accordance with the needs of contemporary society and culture. Results indicate that the multidimensional nature of architectural programming methodological approach in the context of modern heritage and, accordingly, the synergy of different programming values (environmental, human, social, systemic, temporal, economic, aesthetic) provides sustainable access to heritage and has the capacity to improve the social wellbeing of individual users but also of the wider community. © 2021 by the authors.

Travelers have for quite some time been attracted to Pakistan to encounter a nation that flaunts rugged natural beauty, cultural richness, and unparalleled hospitality. Pakistan has various tourist destinations in the northern areas of Pakistan. Kumrat Valley has become a tourist hotspot in recent times after the prime minister of Pakistan, Mr. Imran Khan, visited the valley. To reduce the negative effects on these tourist destinations due to the accelerating increase in tourists, the present study used a quantitative approach to uncover whether there is an environmental awareness–behavior gap among the tourists, with their level of environmental awareness outweighing pro-environmental behavior. Using a sample of 426 tourists who have visited the valley, the analysis of the results indicates that the pro-environmental behavior is positively and significantly affected by the components, environmental awareness, environmental concern, and environmental attachment. Environmental attachment is added as a moderator between environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior.

Over the past few decades, recycling has become widespread, but monetary and energy expenditures required to transport and transform waste materials have led to downsizing of recycling programs globally and in the U.S. This trend increases the need for effective reducing and reusing practices as alternatives to recycling. Using a survey experiment to examine motivations that underlie reducing and reusing behaviors, individuals reported their current reducing, reusing, and recycling practices. Respondents then were provided with three hypothetical scenarios that described (1) an external waste-management threat to public well-being, (2) social/peer pressure from family and friends towards sustainable decision-making, and (3) increased convenience of reusing and reducing practices. These messages reflect previously identified RRR motivations. After the scenarios, the questions regarding recycling, reducing, and reusing behavior were presented again to test for changes in the responses. All three scenarios were effective in increasing intended reducing and reusing behavior. The threat scenario was slightly more effective than the others, particularly among individuals who reported behavior with considerable recycling practices but not as much reducing and reusing. © 2021 by the authors.

With established relationships between human–nature connection (HNC) and pro-environmental behaviour and human well being, there are calls for effective interventions to strengthen HNC in urban settings. However, much of this research has operationalised HNC in narrow psychological terms. Based on an embodied framework of urban human–food connection (HFC) as a specific dimension of HNC, this article explores the role of active urban gardening in promoting different types of internal and external HFC and their link with pro-environmental food behaviour (PEFB). Based on a quantitative survey in Germany addressing vegetable gardeners in Munich (N = 254), a principal component analysis extracted four components of HFC comprising external body-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-body activities: food harvesting and experiential food interaction) and internal mind-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-mind activities including food discovery as well as food consciousness). These were found to be statistically related to one another. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that food consciousness through concerns on food consumption and environmental impacts as well as food as part of life attitude as an internal HFC is the sole predictor of PEFB. The study suggests an embodied HFC model emphasizing the need for local body- and mind-based nature connections for fostering earth stewardship. Future research should explore the relationship between inner dimensions of nature connectedness and external behavioural change to enable transformations towards sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).","Human–nature connection; Pro-environmental behaviour; Sustainable development; Urban food production; Urban gardening","18624065","","","2-s2.0-85101747210"

We used the data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS2013) and obtained a sample of 11,172 respondents, with ages ranging from 18 to 97 years old. The respondents were selected using multistage stratified sampling. Correlational, mediational and moderational analyses were conducted using SPSS. The results show that the childhood subjective socioeconomic status is positively associated with adulthood pro-environmental behavior, independent of the current subjective socioeconomic status. In addition, commercial insurance purchase acts as a mediator of the association between childhood subjective socioeconomic status and adulthood pro-environmental behavior. Using conditional process analysis, we demonstrated that age moderated both the path where childhood subjective socioeconomic status influenced adulthood pro-environmental behavior and the path where childhood subjective socioeconomic status influenced commercial insurance purchase. Theoretically, the results provide empirical support for evolutionary perspective on sustainable behavior and demonstrate that childhood environment can constrain individual consumer choices and lifestyle. Practically, positioning target customers to commercial insurance clients may be an effective marketing strategy to increase consumers’ actual purchase of ethical products. Moreover, to realize environmental goals, social policy makers can make efforts to publicize the importance of insurance and expand the coverage of insurance by increasing the corresponding financial subsidies for low socioeconomic status families. © 2021 by the authors.

One reason behind this shift in priorities is the scarcity mindset triggered by the pandemic. Scarcity is the feeling of having less than what is necessary, and it causes people to prioritize immediate short-term needs over long-term ones. Scarcity experienced in the pandemic can reduce the willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior, leading to environmental degradation that increases the chance of future pandemics. To protect pro-environmental behavior, we argue that it should not be viewed as value-laden and effortful, but rather reconceptualized as actions that address a multitude of human needs including pragmatic actions that conserve resources especially during scarcity. To bolster environmental protection, systematic changes are needed to make pro-environmental behavior better integrated into people's lives, communities, and cities, such that it is more accessible, less costly, and more resilient to future disturbances.

One way coastal communities respond to this challenge is through the environmental stewardship practice of volunteer beach cleanups. Beyond providing temporarily cleaner local beaches, how might these beach cleanups have broader impacts in the global struggle against plastic pollution? Using the lenses of environmental stewardship and civic ecology, we conducted a content analysis of primary source materials created by 50 groups involved in volunteer beach cleanups. We collected data on the scale at which groups coordinate volunteer beach cleanups, the roles they play in conducting these cleanups, how they interact with other volunteer beach cleanup groups, and the other forms of stewardship they conduct, if any. Within our sample, we identified groups coordinating volunteer beach cleanups at five geographic scales: local, sub-national, national, multi-national, and global. Within the groups operating at each scale, we found groups conducting environmental stewardship in the forms of education, advocacy, research, and monitoring in addition to their conservation work through beach cleanups. Our findings demonstrate that groups branch out their impacts by combining different forms of environmental stewardship targeting plastic pollution, and they collaborate to scale up their actions in ways that contribute to plastic pollution governance.

Previous research has found that social norms—beliefs about what most people do and approve of—profoundly impact individual engagement in pro-environmental behaviour. However, little is known about personal and contextual factors that moderate social norm interventions' effectiveness in motivating pro-environmental engagement. The present work conducted two quasi-experimental studies (N = 1501 and N = 237) on a sample of American adults to address this gap. The studies investigated how individual moral norms and personal costs associated with ""acting green"" influence the effectiveness of descriptive norm messages that ask individuals to make a pro-environmental pledge. We found that the strength of moral norms did not moderate the effect of social norms on making a pro-environmental pledge. Rather, our findings suggest that the mere activation of one's moral norms—regardless of how strong they are—can eliminate the effect of social descriptive cues on making a pro-environmental pledge. Finally, we found no evidence that social descriptive norm interventions better promote pro-environmental pledges that require relatively little time and effort for participants to formulate (i.e. low-cost pledges) than commitments that require more cognitive time and effort (i.e. high-cost pledges). Although we note that these findings are preliminary, they offer new insights on the interplay between social and moral norms and help set an agenda for future research on potential moderators of social norm interventions. © 2021","Moral norms; Personal cost; Pro-environmental behaviour; Quasi-experiment; Social norms","26666227","","","2-s2.0-85132700526"

In three experiments we presented participants with either images portraying luxury consumption or neutral images, and then we measured scepticism. Study 1 showed that men increased their scepticism over women when they were exposed to luxury consumption, but not to neutral images.

These originated to promote everyday pro-environmental behaviours that are motivated by a desire for authenticity, ethical living and personal integrity.

We found that Franciscan religious practise Francis’s teachings, but it is difficult to bridge the gap between his teachings and the contemporary context. Students generally identify as environmentalists and respect the environment, but their environmental practice is highly dependent on home life. Both schools and students have to contend with a broader socio-economic context which is pro-Development, with scant regard for the environment. Student understanding of complex global environmental problems, and their causes, is minimal.

In an experiment conducted among 115 children (aged between 7 and 12 years), whose gender and levels of environmental perception before the experiment were controlled for, we show that applying an ‘eco-friendly’ label is sufficient to trigger more subsequent intentions to behave ecologically than what was observed in the control group. We also provide evidence that the most effective age for using this nudge is above 10. Our results show that the intentions to behave ecologically persist a week after labelling. This on-going effect suggests that the influence of social labelling is not limited to the immediate response.

Design/methodology/approach: This explanatory paper applies a Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify the key drivers of pro-environmental intention and behaviour. A non-probability convenience sample of 481 Egyptian respondents was collected. Findings: This study finds that awareness combined with a willingness to pay to mitigate climate change are key drivers of pro-environmental intention. Moreover, personal responsibility and confidence in the ability to mitigate climate change also trigger climate-friendly intentions. Finally, it is found that societal engagement and willingness to take action increase the propensity to exhibit pro-environmental behaviour. Research limitations/implications: The results of our analysis cannot be generalized to the Egyptian population as a whole as our sample only comprises a sample of Egyptian students. Originality/value: This paper is novel as it is the first that applies Qualitative Comparative Analysis to the Theory of Planned Behaviour.

However, it is still unclear whether students only educated in environmental knowledge will decide to engage in green behaviors. This study investigates factors that determine university students’ pro-environmental behaviors, which include environmental activism, nonactivism, and private sphere environmental activities. A proposed model for investigating such factors, which include environmental knowledge and attitudes, self-efficacy, self-obligation, behavioral control, and sociodemographic characteristics, was developed. Questionnaire surveys with 337 students enrolled at King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi in the city of Bangkok, Thailand, were carried out. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test the effect of these potential factors on each type of behavior. The results showed that providing only environmental knowledge at a university may not contribute to any kind of pro-environmental behavior. It was found that environmental knowledge and attitudes had a significant effect on students’ nonactivist behaviors. Without positive environmental attitudes, but with environmental knowledge and self-efficacy, students decided to engage in environmental activism. In addition, male students were more likely to engage in environmental activism than female students. Finally, students’ engagement in private sphere green behaviors was attributed to self-obligation, environmental knowledge, and environmental attitudes, as well as grade point average (GPA). Students with a higher GPA were more likely to act environmentally. Therefore, to promote each type of environmental behavior, different environmental education strategies should be developed. © The Author(s) 2019.","environmental activist behaviors; environmental education; nonactivist behaviors; private sphere environmental behaviors","00131245","","","2-s2.0-85075569073"

Design/methodology/approach: The validity and reliability of the scales of the questionnaires were determined in a sample of 2445 consumers from Lima (Peru), selected through non-probabilistic sampling by quotas and by factorial analysis based on Classical Theory of Tests (CTT) and Structural Equations of Variance with Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). Findings: The results support the construct and discriminant validity of the instrument, as well as the internal consistency of all the subscales (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.662 and 0.8887 – composite reliability between 0.815 and 0.917). Research limitations/implications: Customers evaluated were only from Lima city. It would be important to evaluate, in future research, customers from other cities in Peru. Practical implications: Although a large number of instruments have been designed, not all are based on integral theoretical models, and their metric properties were determined with methodological criteria that restrict their applicability. Therefore, there is a need to have valid and reliable instruments for the identification of environmental behavior and ecological purchasing. Social implications: This “new questionnaire” integrates the exploration of environmental behavior and ecological purchasing, along with the measurement of personal environmental norms, environmental identity and the social influence received from peers and teachers, to provide a comprehensive picture of the consumer behavior. Originality/value: This research constitutes a theoretical and practical contribution to the understanding and evaluation of ecological behavior and some of its associated factors. Its main contribution is the adaptation of this instrument to the Peruvian context and the validation of an instrument that evaluates environmental and ecological purchasing behavior, personal environmental standards, environmental identity and environmental social influence. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Perceived ecological purchasing behavior; Perceived environmental behavior; Reliability; Validity","17471117","","","2-s2.0-85067854326"

In addition to recognising the power of individual attitudes (e.g. environmental value, environmental concern, and environmental knowledge) in predicting tourists’ PEB intentions, this paper highlights the role of social interactions. After reviewing different schools of the social capital theory, this study identifies three social interactional factors, i.e. emotional bonding, in-group norm, and trust in cooperation and examines their power in predicting tourists’ PEB intentions. It further benchmarks the social interactional and individual attitudinal factors that influence tourists’ low-effort and high-effort PEB intentions. An empirical survey study is conducted with over 500 Chinese domestic tourists in an iconic wetland park. Analysis of the data indicates that the social interactional factors are significantly associated with both the low-effort and high-effort PEB intentions of tourists, and the effects are generally stronger for tourists’ high-effort PEB intentions. By contrast, environmental value and environmental concern displayed by the tourists only show positive association with high-effort PEB intentions, and environmental knowledge is unrelated to the PEB intentions of tourists.

We use field-based cognitive experiments to contribute to anthropological theories of the new animism, focusing on concepts of nonhuman agency afforded on one animist framework, that of the Ngöbe of Panama. Results from multiple studies using converging methods indicate that Ngöbe individuals have access to an ecocentric conceptual framework within which agency is inferred on the basis of interactions and relationships (what we term “folkcommunication”). This account represents an alternative to what has often been assumed (by both psychologists and anthropologists) to be a universal conceptual framework of anthropocentric folkpsychology where agency is inferred on the basis of mental states. Further experiments show that the Ngöbe framework supports sophisticated inferences about ecological behavior and that conceptual models exhibit important within-culture variability. Intervening in debates about the nature of animism, we contend that a satisfying theory must account for the productive dimension of animist frameworks and be equipped to discriminate between anthropomorphic and ecocentric conceptual reasoning. Folkcommunication does so by accounting for the cognitive foundations of animism in terms of an ecologically centered perspective—offering a fresh point of departure for understanding Indigenous animisms. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association","agency; animism; folkcommunication; indigenous; social-ecological cognition","00912131","","","2-s2.0-85083984232"

It notes how current “geographical” research is extensive and diverse—including interests in social and natural environments, practice settings, and global issues—but argues for a change whereby it is more explicitly informed by, and cast as, human geography. Part of this change would involve a transition in basic enterprise, whereby researching social work geographically shifts from being a one-way effort on the part of academic social workers, to being a two-way project also involving geographers. Another part would be an important theoretical transition whereby a broadly posthumanist geographical imagination is developed. Moving beyond humanistic privileging of a sovereign subject, this might emphasise distributed agency and a range of more-than-human actors, processes, and forces. Specifically, with this theoretical transition in mind, adopting a recently developed posthumanist theoretical typology, attention is paid to how research might be framed around three spatial processes always at play in the emergence and expression of social work. For each of these processes, resonance is acknowledged in existing social work literature, and final consideration is given to quite specific questions that could be asked and expertise that could be tapped. © 2019 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","17498198","","","2-s2.0-85075040442"

In this context, a reconceptualization of the notion of responsibility as response-ability or ability to respond has gained crucial relevance. This article reads ethics of response as feminist takes on problems posed by the Anthropocene, but also as attempts to conceptualize a non-normativist ethics working with and beyond post-structuralism. The theoretical challenge faced by a feminist post-anthropocentric ethics, the article argues, was posed by feminist philosopher Rosi Braidotti as a confrontation of ‘affirmation versus vulnerability’. In revisiting this debate, the article situates the notion of response-ability and outlines the theoretical questions which must be dealt with by an ethics of response: an integration of affirmation and negativity on one hand, and the question of the ethical and political implications of thinking from constitutive relationality on the other hand. By drawing on the work of Isabelle Stengers, the article maps out one possible conceptualization of an ethics of response-ability in more detail. It introduces the etho-ecological practice of responding as composing with otherness, which enables us to conceptualize the notion of response-ability as a concept underpinning a post-anthropocentric, feminist ethics for the Anthropocene. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","affirmation; Anthropocene; ethics; political ontology; post-anthropocentrism; response-ability; vulnerability","1600910X","","","2-s2.0-85066063092"

Youth showed high initial awareness of the effects of marine debris on the environment but showed less understanding about the role of watersheds and biodegradation in marine litter issues. A majority of youth attributed others’ littering behavior to dispositional factors, like laziness, while attributing their own littering to situational factors, like poorly placed bins. Student observations of educators and parents also influenced littering behaviors and willingness to act.

However, the conditions that lead individuals to behave responsibly at work based on their environmental commitment outside the workplace remain poorly understood. We address this issue by pursuing two objectives. First, we outline archetypes of environmental behavior on and off the job and classify individuals into four profiles: Apathetic, Conformist, Citizen and Enthusiast. Second, we examine a set of organizational and psychological variables that explain the likelihood of behaving in accordance with the principles of an archetype in terms of pro-environmental behavior at work. Our findings show that supervisory support, job self-efficacy and affective commitment increase the likelihood of being green at work but that environmental management practices do not. The results differ according to the profiles identified, allowing a better understanding of employees’ commitment to environmental sustainability.

Results of ordinary least squares and ordered logistic regression analyses indicate women are more likely than men to engage in pro-environmental behaviors in the private sphere.

Experiencing nature during childhood shapes aspects of a personal relationship with nature, crucial for sustainable decision-making processes in adulthood. Scholars often stress the need to 'reconnect' urban dwellers with nature; however, few elaborate on how this can be achieved. Here, we argue that nature reconnection requires urban ecosystems, with a capacity to enable environmental learning in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains, i.e., learning that occurs in the head, heart and hands of individuals. Drawing on environmental psychology, urban ecology, institutional analysis and urban planning, we present a theoretical framework for Human-Nature Connection (HNC), discuss the importance of nurturing HNC for children, elaborate on the role of property-rights and the importance of creating collective action arenas in cities for the promotion of urban resilience building. As values and environmental preconceptions underly environmental behavior, there are limits to achieving HNC in cities, as presumptive sentiments toward nature not always are positive. We end by discussing the role of new digital technologies in relation to HNC, and conclude by summarizing the major points brought forward herein, offering policy recommendations for HNC as a resilience strategy that can be adopted in cities throughout the world. © 2020 by the authors.","Affective and psychomotor environmental learning; Cognitive; Human-nature connection; Immersive technologies; Property rights; Resilience building; Sense of place; Urban green commons","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85085951680"

The authors came to the conclusion that, in the conceptualization of a digital environmental activism, researchers place emphasis either on the features of the digital technologies that drive such activity, or on the basis of the environmental mobilization itself. In this work, combining both approaches with digital environmental activism, the authors understand the voluntary collective activity around common environmental interests and values that are implemented publicly and voluntarily through the use of new informational and communication technologies. The article discusses the main features of digital environmental activism, which include, on the one hand, the enhancement of environmental knowledge, and the change in the paradigm of interaction between actors in which they become not only consumers of information, but also its active producers. On the other hand, digital practices contribute to the alienation of users from the real protest movement by limiting them to virtual means of interaction; additionally, this form of participation is not accessible to all citizens, thereby generating new forms of digital inequality and social distances. The authors examined various types of digital participation which include clicktivism, meta-voting, self-affirmation, e-finance, political consumer protection, digital petitions, botivism, data activity, and hacktivism. The authors critically assess both established and new theoretical approaches to the study of digital eco-activism such as Castells’ theory of network society, deliberative democracy, “citizen science”, socio-psychological theories to explain environmental behavior, and Digital Environmental Humanities.

Design/methodology/approach: Using institutional and resource-based theory, this study uses qualitative approach, and data were collected by interviewing 17 SMEs owners who adopt social and environmental initiatives in their business. Findings: This study found that SME engagement in social and environmental practices is more by the intrinsic values of the owners with strong morality-based motives than the organisational need for competitive advantage. This finding indicates that the SME owner's personal values are translated into corporate values with limited consideration for organisational capacity. Nevertheless, there are various antecedent factors related to SMEs' social and environmental engagement. SMEs' social motives are driven more by the religious values of the owners, while environmental initiatives are generated as a result of the internalisation of knowledge and insight from the education system of the owners. Practical implications: This study finding revealed that experiences of SME owners during their school time significantly affect their environmental interests. Accordingly, the authors argued that the education for sustainable development agendas should be thoughtfully designed in higher education's curriculum and ecosystem. So, the mindset of social and environmental awareness had been cultivated as the core value of future entrepreneurs.

However, in Malaysia, the implementation level of environmental practices is still moderate among public listed companies. This study, therefore, examines organisational isomorphism as the determinant of the extent of environmental management accounting practices by Malaysian public listed companies in the Main Market, based on institutional theory. Coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphisms were taken as the determinants of the extent of usage of environmental management accounting. A survey method was used, consisting of sending an online questionnaire for data collection to Malaysian public listed companies. Statistical analyses were used to analyse the variables. The survey results revealed that these companies have, to a great extent, implemented environmental management accounting. It was also found that coercive isomorphism significantly influenced the environmental management accounting practices of Malaysian public listed companies. This suggests that companies will implement environmentally-related practices with the existence of coercive pressures, derived from government and shareholders. The implementation of environmental management accounting is beneficial in overcoming the problem of traditional management accounting, which fails to incorporate hidden environmental costs. Thus, the empirical findings from the study put forth crucial, specific factors that could aid the government in encouraging companies to become responsible, and to contribute to green initiatives through environmental management accounting practices. © 2020 Conscientia Beam.

A household telephone survey was carried out, and 481 successful samples were collected. SPSS 24.0 was used for the statistical analysis of the collected data. The results of the current study showed that individuals with no political orientation and a pro-centrism stance represent up to 60% of the population in Hong Kong. Liberals reported the highest levels of EA and ERB, followed by the intermediate groups of pro-centrists and individuals with no political orientation. Conservatives were found to be least concerned about the environment and least involved in ERB. Thus, a gradual decrease in EA and ERB from liberals to conservatives was observed. A discrepancy between the levels of EA and ERB among all the participants was found. Reasons for such differences were suggested based on local societal atmosphere and attitudes towards ERBs that oppose the government. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental attitude; Environmental policy; Environmentally responsible behaviour; Political orientation","14629011","","ESCPF","2-s2.0-85067056992"

Rational choice theory suggests that individuals will only behave in pro-environmental ways if they perceive those actions to align with their own self-interests. Others, however, have highlighted instances where individuals act pro-socially or altruistically, deviating from their own self-interests for the benefit of others. The present study examines whether individuals' social preferences are associated with engagement in pro-environmental behaviors. Specifically, drawing on a methodology from behavioral economics, we use dictator and ultimatum game behavior to measure social preferences, and we then evaluate whether heterogeneity in social preferences is associated with self-reported pro-environmental behaviors and observed recycling behavior. The results indicate that individual differences in social preferences have a modest association with self-reported pro-environmental behaviors but no association with observed recycling behavior. Self-reported pro-environmental behavior was not associated with observed recycling behavior. We also find that recycling bin proximity to classroom doors increased participation in recycling. This finding demonstrates that individuals are receptive to the proximate opportunity to recycle. This suggests increasing the ease with which people can engage in pro-environmental behaviors, such as recycling, will promote participation in these practices. Overall, our research indicates that social preferences do not seem to drive individuals to act in environmentally friendly ways. This work also provides new opportunities for future research to integrate economic games into the study of pro-environmental behaviors. © 2020 by the authors.","Altruism; Dictator game; Environmental behavior; Recycling; Social preferences; Ultimatum game","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85089404056"

FSP and sharing of ‘garden produce’ is a long-term socioeconomic phenomenon in Croatia but so far there has been no research on the whole population in regard to FSP. We explore how widespread FSP in Croatia is, based on a survey of a nationally representative sample (N = 1000), within a broader social stratification project. We further explore the class structure of FSP practitioners and compare it to their reported motivations for engaging with the practice, and their pro-environmental behaviour, resilience and personal flourishing. Previous research in CEE has shown that FSP is characteristic of between 35% and 60% of national populations (Smith and Jehlička, 2013), whereas our findings show that a little over 50% of respondents claim that they have a garden, field or orchard, they use to produce food for themselves and part of their social network. As a practice it is more situated in smaller settlements and rural areas, but it is not a principally rural phenomenon. Slim majority of people involved in FSP in Croatia are identified as working class, however, FSP is not a coping strategy focused on the poor and low-income households in Croatia and food self-provisioners report higher level of personal wellbeing, more pro-environmental behaviour and higher level of self-perceived resilience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Croatia; Food self-provisioning; Food sharing; Pro-environmental behaviour; Resilience; Social class; Wellbeing","00167185","","","2-s2.0-85070226722"

Yet, the connection between environmental awareness, concern, attitude, and behavior is neither direct nor clear. Various factors have been demonstrated to influence environmentally responsible behavior (ERB), including: attitudes, values, knowledge, affect, context, and social capital. We contribute to this conversation by exploring the mechanisms that community participation, social trust, and strong ties influence ERB in an urban context. Our results indicate that dimensions of social capital effect environmentally responsible behavior through environmental concern. Specifically, we find that social trust is a significant predictor of both environmental concern and locus of control. These results provide insight into the small but growing literature on environmental concern, social capital, and ERB and suggest that policies and practices that increase social trust can lead to more environmentally responsible behavior and advance urban sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Environmental psychology; Pro-environmental behavior; Social Capital; Structural equation modeling; Urban sustainability","14629011","","ESCPF","2-s2.0-85087836537"

Results indicate that the environmentalism frame, indicated by environmental identity but not attitudes, enhances all the behaviors examined: general conservation, cost-saving conservation, recycling, and advocacy. Effects of environmental justice, however, are more limited. Passion for environmental protection likewise positively affects all pro-environmental actions, and moral outrage over the condition of the environment exerts strong positive effects on conservation and advocacy.

Based on a principle component analysis on data for 23 different PEBs, three behavior types were distinguished: (i) public sphere PEBs with politically mediated impacts; (ii) socially salient private “lighthouse” PEBs that convey a pro-environmental message; and (iii) less socially salient private PEBs. An environmental behavior model identified general environmental knowledge and attitudes as the strongest predictors of PEBs, followed by green self-identity, justifications, assumed consequences, prescriptive social norms, gender, age, and perceived behavioral control (PBC), respectively. To promote sustainability-oriented behaviors and achieve corresponding societal and economic changes, the identified psychological factors need to be promoted by education and communication strategies as well as complementary measures ranging from policy changes to technology development and systems design. Green self-identity turned out to be significantly more influential for private PEBs than for public sphere PEBs, whereas prescriptive social norms and environmental knowledge were more important for public sphere PEBs. These findings indicate that promoting different types of sustainability-oriented behaviors may require distinct strategies. Public sphere PEBs may be enhanced well by conveying social practices and norms, whereas the promotion of a pro-environmental green self-identity may increase private sphere PEBs effectively. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to explore how forest school as a growing phenomenon in the UK is promoting this reconnection to nature as well as benefiting children's well-being. At the same time, forest school is providing children and young people with a more divergent learning experience, away from the structural pressures of the neoliberal classroom. With its emphasis on play-based learning in wooded areas, and the freedom to make connections and spatially engage with what is around them at their own pace, such engagement in these “alternative” learning spaces can support the development of a post-human discourse and sensibilities. This is fundamental in developing children's emotional connection in promoting pro-environmental behaviours and their attitudes towards valuing and protecting the non-human. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on field notes documented during forest school leader training undertook by the author from April 2017 to May 2018. Further data were collected in the form of participant observations of forest school sessions in three schools; semi-structured interviews with the head teachers of these schools and two forest school practitioners. Supplementary data will also draw on the experiences of a group of second-year education studies university students after completing a module on forest school and outdoor learning, led by the author. Findings: This article finds that the more children engage with wooded areas and interact with the natural environment and other creatures within that space, the more it affords meaning to them. This in turn promotes a sense of belonging and environmental stewardship, particularly in relation to non-human creatures. This article also finds that where schools provide forest school opportunities on their sites, such provision is conducive to supporting more creative practices within the “spatialities” of the neoliberal classroom. Originality/value: Neoliberal education policy with its focus on high stakes testing and performance outcomes increasingly shapes the spatial practices of school life. Consequently, time spent outdoors and its relationship with intrinsic learning has declined in many schools. With many schools placing less importance on outdoor learning, children and young people have become further alienated from engaging in different ways with their environments. Further, data highlighting the link between forest school and children's interest in plants and other animals have not been the subject of much research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Creaturely relations; Environmental education; Forest school; Neoliberal performativity","0144333X","","","2-s2.0-85086248623"

Observed/expected prevalence ratios were computed to assess clustering patterns and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the pairwise associations. Among 8816 Canadian households, prevalence of engaging in pro-environmental behaviors ranked as the following: engaging in green consumer behavior (88%), composting food/yard waste (84%), being active outdoors (82%), gardening (72%), and recycling electronics (45%). While only 14% engaged in =2 pro-environmental behaviors, 25.1% of Canadians engaged in all pro-environmental behaviors.

This study aims to achieve this by examining how people perceive emotional campaigns on climate change and to what extent they ultimately perform actions to achieve adequate responses to environmental hazards and protection. Design/methodology/approach: This study measured environmental behavior directly through donations to environmental charities in two experimental conditions (i.e. top-down vs same-level communication). Environmental emotions were measured via pride and guilt levels about their own country’s environmental actions. Findings: Powerful individuals appeal to those people who are usually less driven to behave sustainably, and thus induce guilt regardless of the participant’s environmental identity. Conversely, powerful speakers did not succeed in addressing low identity participants using positive emotions. In fact, high power results in even lower pride levels, indicating a potentially adverse effect of power. Research limitations/implications: While this paper successfully used an organizational leader as a powerful individual, it would be a fruitful avenue to use the experimental framework and examine different presenters (such as politicians, non-governmental organization leaders or scientific experts) who embody environmental advocacy. Practical implications: The results on top-down communication are intended to add to the understanding of emotional power in environmental contexts and help policy-makers to foster environmental advocacy using emotion-inducing campaigns. Originality/value: The study is among the first to examine and elucidate the circumstances under which powerful individuals can encourage pro-environmental behavior. This study provides evidence that power can be a useful tool to appeal to those people who are usually less driven to behave sustainably. However, this paper also found that power does not increase emotions and behavior per se. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emotions; Environmental identity; Policy development; Power; Pro-environmental behavior","17471117","","","2-s2.0-85091274735"

Modelled as a multidimensional construct, sustainable development practices are represented by environmental practices, social practices in the workplace and social practices in the community, while financial performance is determined by profitability and growth. Using a mixed method survey, data were obtained from 389 textile firms in Vietnam, where there is a dire need to promote sustainable and environmental practices. Data analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling demonstrates that sustainable development practices positively affect financial performance directly and indirectly via customer loyalty, employee satisfaction and corporate reputation. The findings also reveal the moderating role of entrepreneurial orientation, whereby the impact of sustainable development practices on financial performance is stronger for firms that are more innovative, proactive and willing to take risks. Taken together, these findings provide support for firms to holistically implement sustainable development practices and adopt an entrepreneurial orientation. © 2020 by the authors.","Corporate reputation; Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty; Employee satisfaction; Entrepreneurial orientation; Financial performance; Sustainable development practices; Textile; Vietnam","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85089751589"

This study is the first to explore the factors affecting an individual’s binning behaviour in the context of a national park. Drawing on theories with self-interest (i.e. theory of planned behaviour) and other-interest/pro-social (i.e. norm-activation model) motives, an integrated structural model of binning behaviour (IMB) was developed. Our study analysed data from visitors (n = 240) to Sorkh-e-hesar National Park in Iran. Based on our proposed integrated theory of planned behaviour and norm activation model, the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) provided satisfactory empirical anticipatory efficacy for binning behaviours. The PLS-SEM results revealed the association between awareness of consequences and personal norms was the strongest, and personal norm was the most influential determinant of pro-environmental binning behaviour. The results also showed that attitude had no significant effect on binning behaviour but was influenced by awareness of consequences. Moreover, a salient role of personal norms in predicting binning behaviour emerged–personal norms illuminated a significant mediator between social norms, awareness of consequences and binning behaviour. Results of this study endorse the proposed theoretical framework, including the associations among study variables. National park agencies should strengthen the saliency of visitors’ personal norms and raise awareness of littering problems and social norms to increase visitors’ bin use while visiting the park. Highlights We studied national park visitors pro-environmental binning behaviour by presenting an Integrated Model of Binning behaviour (IMB) drawing from the theory of planned behaviour and the norm activation model. The model was tested using survey data collected from visitors of Sorkh-e-hesar National Park in Iran. Personal norm is a strong mediator between awareness of consequences and social norms. Awareness of consequences has the highest direct, indirect and specific indirect effect on binning behaviour.

However, we know little in regard to how these contextual factors and their interaction with individual-level factors shape environmental concern within countries. Using China as an example, we examine three hypotheses: the affluence hypothesis, the degradation hypothesis, and the need contingency hypothesis. We measure environmental concern in three dimensions using twelve indicators. The latent mean comparison and multilevel structural equation modeling results show that provincial economic development and environmental degradation as well as their interactions with individual social-economic status have significant impacts on one’s environmental concern. Such impacts vary by the dimension of environmental concern. People from provinces with better economic conditions generally have higher environmental concern, especially for the perceived dangerousness of pollution and environmental behavior dimensions.

The proposed theoretical model is grounded in marketing literature, extends the theory of planned behavior, and empirically tested in the Indian market. A survey with questionnaire was administered to gather data from 510 respondents from the state capital of the country. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses; the results confirm adequate support for the theory of planned behavior and proposed theoretical model. In addition, ECCB found to be significantly influenced by the consumers' environmental knowledge, and perceived environmental consequences, and environmental concern was significantly related to WEF. The study implies that green marketers should direct their marketing efforts towards integrating these four pro-environmental behavior determinants in order to facilitate the ECCB and WEF for green products. For promoting the ECCB, green marketers should strengthen environmental knowledge and perceived environmental consequences to target consumers, and for augmenting the WEF, they should improve the environment concern among consumers.

Ultimately, this intensified consumption can negate the positive effect of energy efficiency improvements in tourism, the phenomenon known as the time use rebound effect.

We further show that the effect is driven by a stronger feeling of personal responsibility toward the environment among individuals who possess a dominant global identity. Findings from this research suggest that the formation of stronger global identity, a psychological consequence of increasing globalization, can have an important impact on people’s pro-environmental behavior. © The Author(s) 2019.","environment-friendliness; global identity; globalization; personal responsibility","00220221","","","2-s2.0-85073027373"

We find that knowledge of changes to the polar region is positively related to concern for the polar region. But, when looking at willingness to make behavioral changes, concern for the polar regions remains the strongest predictor, while there is little direct effect of individual self-assessed knowledge. Further, concern for the polar region remains a robust predictor of willingness to make behavioral changes, even after individual driving habits are introduced to the model.

In order to realize and internalize environmental awareness as a social consensus, it is imperative for every member of a household to be involved in transforming everyday behavior. Intergenerational interactions are of paramount importance. Accordingly, the focus of this study was on parent-adolescent interactions, their reciprocal impact on environmental behaviors, and the factors that have an influence on these processes. Questionnaires were employed to collect information of 684 families in 10 districts of Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province. Subsequently, interviews were conducted with 15 of these families to comprehend the tangible reasons underlying intergenerational interactions in environmental behaviors. First, a paired sample T-test was employed to compare the frequency of these interactions. The data showed that while the T values were positive in all eight compared groups, there were significant differences in seven of them. These results suggest that the impact of intergenerational interactions on environmental behaviors is not symmetrical: parents' instructions are far more frequent than adolescents' back-feeding of ecological notions. The interviews revealed that this phenomenon was generated primarily by unequal experiences between parents and adolescents because the latter do not participate in housework and family projects. Furthermore, the traditional concept of intergenerational order appears to be permanent. Second, two linear regression models, a Parent-to-Adolescent model and an Adolescent-to-Parent model that encompassed several factors including family structure, intergenerational relationships, living environment, and families' social class were developed. Among these factors, the intergenerational relationship variable played a particularly significant role: the more equal and open-minded dialogs are incorporated into parent-adolescent communication, the more favorable interactions may occur for development of their environmental behaviors. Thus, when an environmental education system with families is constructed, it is imperative to promote a parent's ecological awareness with the help of grass-roots organizations by means of reasonable rewards and punishments to redress their former behaviors so as to let Big Hands Guide Small Hands. It is also crucial to enhance a more equal intergenerational relationship through parents' schooling or other relevant services so as to create a favorable atmosphere for Small Hands Guide Big Hands. © 2021 The Author","Adolescent; Environmental behavior; Environmental education; Family influencing factors; Intergenerational interaction","10042857","","","2-s2.0-85133261910"

The findings allow us to disrupt dominant conceptions of household sustainability and to challenge the assumption that newcomers from ‘less developed countries’ need to be socialised into adopting household sustainability practices.

To examine if the 2-MEV exceeds the NEP scale in predictability of people’s environmental attitudes in China and its applicability to Chinese children, we modified the 2-MEV scale in Chinese and used it to question 490 students (aged 9–12) in China. The results show that the modified version demonstrated good reliability and internal consistency. Furthermore, the 2-MEV demonstrated significantly a higher predictive power of PEB than the NEP.

Creating a reunion between local community and residents is important, and local identity should also be transformed conceptually.

The results show that although neighbourhood attachment (NA) is an important component of urban local identity, now more than NA, upkeep and care (UC) create a local identity.

Seeking to re-negotiate the material flows of their daily lives to account for discomfort with contemporary social and environmental risk, homesteaders and preppers adopt an environmental self-sufficiency practice that purports to decrease or eliminate reliance on institutions they distrust, a model I call “the self-sufficient citizen.” Homesteaders and preppers experience a double bind of reliance and distrust, which they channel into renegotiating their ecological habitus. They do so by calling on traditional American beliefs in individual responsibility, which, although they appear politically neutral, reinforce the dominant power structures that they distrust.

Feminist political ecologists have made important theoretical interventions in the interdisciplinary community of political ecologists, but the use of feminist methodologies and 'team-based environmental science’ can be expanded. We argue that revisiting feminist methodological commitments is critical for furthering how feminist political ecology examines how, and in what way, power and privilege operate in the contexts where environmental knowledge is produced. We make our argument by drawing upon a multi-year, multi-sited project to describe how collaborative event ethnography (CEE) offers many possibilities to reassess feminist political ecology research designs. We show how the recognition of diverse and plural epistemologies are foundational preconditions to integrating feminist principles in feminist political ecology research. We find that integrating reflexivity, responsibility, and co-production in research designs create opportunities for, and challenges to, carrying out feminist political ecological practice. In so doing, the integration of feminist methodologies are critical to disrupting knowledge hegemonies and providing new modes of practicing feminist political ecologies.","Collaborative event ethnography; feminist methodologies; feminist political ecology; global environmental governance","10730451","","","2-s2.0-85098130550"

Drawing on the complex phenomenon of social norms theory concerning misperceptions (i.e., pluralistic ignorance) and supervisor-subordinate guanxi (which is a Chinese term signifying human connection), we present a novel model in which employees' pro-environmental behaviour is the result of multiple social and individual psychological factors. Through the integration of previous literature from the fields of the psychology of individuals, social psychology, and environmental psychology, the major assumption is that the pro-environmental behaviour of employees is affected by their level of pluralistic ignorance, environmental concern, and subjective norms; these, in turn, are influenced by supervisor-subordinate guanxi and social identity in the collective spirit of Chinese society. Data, which were analysed empirically, were gathered from 548 Chinese employees from the Jiangsu province of China. This study consequently reveals the subtle interplay among employees' pluralistic ignorance, supervisor-subordinate guanxi, social identity, subjective norms, environmental concern, and their pro-environmental behaviour, while the deeper analysis offers considerable support for environmental management research and practice. © 2019 by the authors.","Pluralistic ignorance; Pro-environmental behaviour; Social identity; Social norms; Subjective norm; Supervisor-subordinate guanxi","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85079547662"

In social psychology, the values–beliefs–norms (VBN) theory is one of the most common approaches used to explain pro-environmental behaviors. But different sets of concepts have often been used in work based on large public opinion surveys. Here, we add to the VBN theory several variables—Christian religious fundamentalism, willingness to sacrifice, trust in scientists, biotechnology beliefs—that have been used in the public opinion literature in a step toward a more integrative theory. A sample of 518 U.S. adults completed an online questionnaire to provide data. Results confirm that, in the USA, biospheric altruism values had substantial indirect effects on pro-environmental behavior via willingness to sacrifice for biodiversity loss. But climate change beliefs and willingness to sacrifice for climate change did not exert direct or indirect effects on pro-environmental behavior. Interestingly, religious fundamentalism increased pro-environmental behavior net of other factors including political ideology, again acting primarily through biospheric altruism values.

However, this culture of production and family is under pressure from societal calls to increase the uptake of environmental practices in farm management. The pressure is leading farmers to adopt environmental practices, which causes a clash with the beliefs and values underlying the culture of production and family business. This clash is problematic, as it might form a barrier to sustained environmental change, for which not only practice change is required, but also a change in beliefs and values guiding the farming culture. This study explores the clash using an institutional perspective to: i) analyse how farmer practices, beliefs and values change due to external pressure to adopt environmental practices; ii) identify mechanisms via which this change unfolds; and iii) understand the role of participatory extension programmes in this change. An institutional perspective enables this study to move beyond the role of individual's attitudes and behaviours in adoption of environmental practices, towards considering how farmers' practices, beliefs and values together constitute the culture of farming, and how these are shaped by societal and institutional mechanisms. Twenty Scottish and 52 New Zealand farmers participated in qualitative, open-ended interviews and were observed during discussion groups or advisory meetings. Our findings show that all farmers are guided by a ‘business’, ‘lifestyle’ and/or ‘learning’ logic. The institutional clash influenced practices underlying the business logic to change from being purely based on maximising productivity, to including environmental aspects. However, no change in values was observed. Participatory extension programmes influenced practices, beliefs and values underlying the learning logic (changing from a ‘linear’ to ‘multi-actor’ logic) and thus can help facilitate more effective practice change by providing support via micro-mechanisms and enabling dynamics. The study contributes to current literature by introducing a new lens for understanding change induced by participatory extension programmes and by providing change agents, such as extensionists, with more in-depth knowledge about the main logics guiding the culture of farming, and the mechanisms by which farmer practices, beliefs and values may change. The in depth-knowledge will help to communicate, frame and organise extension initiatives. © 2020 The Authors","Bottom-up processes; Discussion groups; Institutional change; Institutional logics; Participatory extension; Practice change","07430167","","JRSTF","2-s2.0-85087886114"

By examining community experiences in the establishment of Timor-Leste’s first national park, this article highlights the inadequate attention directed towards addressing these concerns. It proposes ‘transitional’ environmentality as a novel framework that first, better reflects the ever-transient nature of environmental behaviour and regulation; and second, recognizes the prevalence for this in post-conflict landscapes.

This paper advances this research direction by integrating the mechanisms of cognition and incentives from the externalities/spillovers perspective. This paper argues that we can view the environmental and financial benefits received by hotels and natural environment as positive spillovers from employees' voluntary pro-environmental behaviours. Accordingly, internalization (the subject of positive spillovers cognitively perceives oneness with beneficiaries like hotels and physical environment) and compensation (beneficiaries offer incentives for positive spillovers' subject) are two leading solutions to the positive spillovers issue, which can improve employees' engagement in pro-environmental behaviours. Hence, this paper explores the impact of employees' cognitive internalization (work ethic) and positive incentives from the organization and nature (hotel's environmental benefit sharing and health rewards rooted in employees' ecological embeddedness) on employees' pro-environmental behaviours in the hotel industry. The empirical analysis of a sample of 324 employees working in Chinese luxury hotels suggests that employees' work ethic, hotel's environmental benefit sharing and employees' ecological embeddedness are significantly positively related to employees' pro-environmental behaviours and that the interplay of employees' work ethic and ecological embeddedness significantly and negatively affects employees' pro-environmental behaviours. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese hotel industry; ecological embeddedness; environmental benefit sharing; Pro-environmental behaviours; work ethic","09669582","","","2-s2.0-85068599446"

The M-R model was employed to construct an integrated model of the influence of consumer landscape on pro-environment behavior and loyalty in organic agricultural tourism. The research framework and questionnaire design were constructed on the basis of literature review and 417 valid questionnaires which were collected from tourists in Eastern Taiwan (Hualien and Taidong). SPSS was employed to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire and LISREL software was used to identify the influence path between variables. The results showed that: 1. The tourists' cognition of consumer landscape will positively affect the environmental intimacy and environmental identity. 2. Tourists' environmental intimacy and environmental identity will increase their pro-environmental behavior. 3. Tourists' pro-environment behavior has a positive impact on their loyalty to organic agricultural tourism. The results show that organic agricultural tourism can stimulate tourists to understand the significance, importance and multiple values of the environment, and increase the intimacy and identity of tourists to the environment, which has a great effect on pro-environment behavior and loyalty.

We have addressed this by manipulating the context of (im)moral vs. environmentally (un)friendly behaviours. This is because environmental behaviours are classified as moral, yet they are often driven by different moral motives. We wanted to find out whether this difference could be captured by colour-emotion associations with guilt and pride. We have used an online colour picker to examine over 400 UK participants. The results of the RGB colour model revealed that guilt was most commonly associated with red, black, green, and violet colours. However, the colours of immoral behaviours were much darker than the colours of environmentally unfriendly behaviours. In contrast, pride in moral behaviours was mostly associated with pink, violet, green and blue, whereas pride in environmentally friendly behaviours was mostly paired with green, suggesting that moral context, indeed, has an impact on colour-emotion associations of guilt and pride. In addition, our study has uncovered that colour-emotion associations of guilt and pride are comprised of a certain colour signature, rather than a single colour, and this signature varies with the alteration of context.

A multilevel model measures the effect of individual-level environmental factors and analyzes the impact of the country context on Europeans' environmental behaviors. Results show that the three tested environmental behaviors (eco-friendly purchasing, public transport use, and reduced resource consumption) are explained by individual-level environmental factors as well as by country differences, but the effects differ depending on the behavior considered.

Past research suggests morality is an important driver of such efforts. But it is not known empirically whether people interpret individual-level environmental practices and impact as moral issues. Through analyses of 64 semi-structured interviews, we identify two conditions under which environmental practices and impact influence moral judgments. First, environmental impact must be part of the evaluator's moral culture. We complement and extend existing literature by demonstrating that liberals are more likely than conservatives to make moral evaluations of individual efforts to reduce environmental impact. Second, the evaluator must view the actor as behaving intentionally. People perceive high-income actors as more likely than low-income actors to intentionally reduce environmental impact and, accordingly, view high-income people engaged in green practices as more moral. We confirm the effects of environmental practices and income on the moral judgments that liberals and conservatives make using an online vignette experiment. The experiment was conducted with a nationally-representative sample of US households through NSF's Time-Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (TESS).

Why are there such individual differences? Considering that guilt is a predominantly interpersonal phenomenon, as emotion research has demonstrated, how is it possible that some individuals feel guilty for the degradation of the non-human environment, and some others do not? The present investigation tests an integrated solution to these two questions based on the concept of anthropomorphism. In three studies, with an individual difference approach, it was observed that anthropomorphism of nature predicted the experience of environmental guilt, and this feeling in turn was associated with engagement in pro-environmental behavior. That is, it appears that individuals who view nature in anthropomorphic terms are more likely to feel guilty for environmental degradation, and they take more steps toward environmental action. This observation not only improves existing understanding of environmental guilt, but also adds evidence to the theoretical possibility of describing and understanding the human-nature relationship with reference to psychological knowledge regarding interpersonal relationships. © 2019 by the authors.","Anthropomorphism; Emotion; Guilt; Human-nature relationship; Pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85073473883"

The hope is that well-informed citizens make well-informed choices and thus act in a sustainable way. However, this common but drastic simplification that more information about climate change automatically leads to pro-environmental behaviour is fundamentally flawed. It completely neglects the complex social-psychological processes that occur if people are confronted with threatening information. In reality, the defence mechanisms that are activated in such situations can also work against the goal of sustainable development, as experimental studies showed.

Design/methodology/approach: A double approach, both quantitative and qualitative, of social representation theory was adopted. The data collection was undertaken in two phases. First, the content and organization of social representation of climate change (SRCC) was examined with a quantitative study of 946 participants for both countries, followed by a qualitative study of 63 participants for both countries also. Findings: The study finds unicity in the SRCC for the quantitative study. In contrast, the qualitative study highlights differences at the level of the institutional anchoring of the climate change phenomenon in these two different socioeconomic and political contexts. Practical implications: These results are relevant for a reflection in terms of public policies for the prevention and management of collective natural risks, as well as for the promotion of ecological behavior adapted to political and ideological contexts.

Planning as a political practice is replaced by environmentally-behavioral control, in which subjectivity is articulated above-individually (permeating the city with sensitive nodes) and infra-individually (transforming citizens into sensitive nodes). This leads us to the research question: how to focus on the social relations and processes of the smart urbanization which are based on the second order cybernetic approach? The smart city is understood as a complex mechanism, where one begins to realize the often-unintended human, environmental, social and economic consequences of a technological and engineering-led approach. The latest thinking and smart urban projects are aimed at comprehending smart and/or sustainable infrastructure as a network between places and people in order to create a more sustainable, healthy and resilient future for different groups of citizens (from young people to seniors). Municipality strategies need to address global socio-economic factors, processes of innovation with new technology, constant adaptation in public and private sector organisations and the diversity of qualified resources.  © 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","cybernetics; internet of services; internet of things; smart city; urban innovation; urbanisation","15691322","","CSOOB","2-s2.0-85090297651"

The results show that even though using efficient bulbs is commonly portrayed as easy, it can involve six phases of additional labor. The case of CFLs indicates that home climate practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work, particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties. Because home climate practices like using CFLs are the kind of work traditionally performed by women, they can expand the gender “climate gap” and are often devalued in inequitable ways.

Place attachment refers to the emotional bonding or engagement between an individual and a particular environmental setting. It influences what a tourist sees, thinks and feels about the place and destination visited. Even though the place attachment concept has been explored in different perspectives, it is yet to be fully examined together with pro-environmental behavioural intentions, especially in the ecotourism context. Thus, this study aims to analyse the influence of place attachment on the pro-environmental behavioural intentions of ecotourists in Taman Negara National Park (TNNP), Pahang. A survey was carried out among 387 local and international ecotourists in TNNP, Pahang to examine the relationship between the four dimensions of place attachment (including place identity, place affects, place dependence and place social bonding) on ecotourist behaviour. The results suggest that only place dependence and place identity significantly influence pro-environmental behavioural intentions; while none of these dimensions has a significant relationship with ecotourist's actual pro-environmental behaviour. Future research should explore the mediating and moderation effects of the socio-demographic profile of ecotourists on the relationship between place attachment and behavioural intention in different ecotourism sectors. © The Author(s) 2020.

The scale development process included four steps: extensive literature review on environmental incentives, generation of an item pool, evaluation of the initial item pool by a panel of experts, and administration of the final item pool to a population sample to test the psychometric properties of the scale. We collected five distinct samples to: (1) explore the factorial structure of the MEPS using Exploratory Factor Analysis (Study 1); (2) confirm the proposed structure using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and assess reliability and validity (Studies 2 and 3); (3) examine test-retest reliability (Study 4); and (4) evaluate the MEPS in a representative sample (Study 5). The overall findings supported a seven-factor structure for the 28-item MEPS, revealed good scale reliability and provided evidence of construct validity in terms of discriminant and convergent validity. The scale exhibited criterion-related validity as suggested by the correlations observed between each MEPS subscale and other outcome variables. Results showed that configural, measurement and latent mean invariance were established across gender groups.

In this study, Czech students at upper-primary and secondary-school levels responded to a set of covertly paired statements designed to assess their beliefs concerning the usefulness of actions that might ameliorate global warming and the degree to which they are willing to act. Relations between their beliefs and willingness to act were assessed by means of an index of Potential Effectiveness of Education (PEE). The results show that Czech students are generally sceptical about the usefulness of the actions suggested and are among the less willing, in a wider international context, to participate in actual processes that might ameliorate global warming. However, Czech secondary-school students, particularly females, are significantly more willing to act than upper-primary students. Although relatively high PEE values were observed, Czech students tend to underestimate the role of personal consumption and male students in particular are not willing to take actions that involve no immediate personal benefit.

This survey-based research was conducted with 453 middle and high school students within a large urban area of the western United States. Through structural equation modelling, it was found that knowledge about climate change causes and effects was a weak predictor of behaviour. Whereas social norms accepting of climate change, and the paths from social norms via efficacy and certainty, were strong predictors of behaviour. Certainty of human attribution and efficacy were rather weak predictors, mediating the influence of knowledge and norms. Students’ grade level, participation in clubs and number of science classes primarily affected knowledge and social norms.

Concern about global environmental issues influenced pro-environmental behavior both directly and indirectly. As the theory of planned behavior suggests, behavioral intention to protect the environment mediated the relationship. In line with the endowment effect theory, people were more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior when they were more content with the quality of environment in the neighborhood. However, the influence of the perception of local environmental conditions on pro-environmental behavior was mainly indirect via emotional attachment to a local community. Overall, ordinary people's perception of global environmental issues was a stronger predictor of individual pro-environmental behavior than was their perception of local environmental conditions, suggesting that ""Think globally, act locally"" is not merely a slogan for environmentalism, but also a description of what people are actually doing in everyday life. Theses findings therefore suggest that highlighting global environmental problems rather than focusing on local environmental problems would indeed be an effective communicative strategy to promote proenvironmental behavior in everyday life. © 2018, Institute of Social Development and Policy Research, Seoul National University.","Environmental communications; Environmental concern; Place attachment; Pro-environmental behavior; The endowment effect theory","15988074","","","2-s2.0-85059913419"

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed as research method. Results show that males display higher PEB than their female counterparts. Married consumers score more on PEB than single. Mid-age consumers (36–50) also score high on PEB than young and old-age consumers. Furthermore, highly educated consumers are more pro-environmentalist than graduates and post-graduates. The novelty of this study is that centers on the use of demographic variables interactively in order to form microsegments. For instance, married men score more on PEB scale than unmarried men and women and prefer green channels even more (i.e., public transportation). On the contrary, unmarried women display no hesitation in paying more for energy-efficient goods compared to married men and unmarried men. Marketers may aim in setting such PEBs as the moral standards among consumers being an easily identifiable segment as their prime target. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Emerging market; MANOVA; Pro-environmental behavior; Socio-demographics","22106723","","","2-s2.0-85052556668"

We explore three research questions relating social and physical attributes of a firm's location with its engagement in a voluntary environmental program (VEP). Drawing on a sample of hotels participating in a Costa Rican VEP, we find that the number of VEP certified competitors (i.e. green competitors) and firm proximity to a sacrosanct environment (i.e. a green locale) are positively related to a firm's level of VEP engagement. We also find an interaction effect such that the relationship between the number of VEP certified competitors and the level of VEP engagement is positively moderated by firm proximity to a green locale.

Using data gathered using multiple methods in and around Mopan and Q’eqchi’ Maya villages in southern Belize, the paper outlines how ecological practices related to land use are valued and valuable in several, interlinked ways: through their contribution to what makes a “healthy life,” through their part in defining what it means to be “Maya” and have Maya heritage, and through their distinct role in the learning of skills as part of the informal education process. Informed by this research and the data collected through the implementation of the lessons themselves, this paper identifies how formalizing these ecological practices as part of an environmental and cultural heritage curriculum for primary schools, while not without challenges, has potential to positively impact well-being in indigenous communities, thereby promoting social justice through the maintenance of the ability to live healthy, valued lives. © 2016, AESS.","Belize; Cultural heritage; Environmental anthropology; Environmental curriculum; Environmental education; Health; Maya; Wellness","21906483","","","2-s2.0-85027030539"

Given a growing global population and rapid urbanization, shifting contemporary carbon-intensive food consumption trends is essential. As such, encouraging pro-environmental behaviour change and pro-environmental food consumption behaviour in particular is as an important challenge; reducing our collective foodprint is an important way of reducing our collective carbon footprint. Yet, despite widespread consumer awareness of climate change, consumption behaviours are rarely consistent with environmentally friendly aspirations. This empirical research emphasizes the contribution and the potential of community gardens as a means of fostering pro-environmental behaviour change towards low-carbon food consumption. It evaluates the role of London’s community gardens in promoting participants’ environmentally friendly food consumption patterns, thereby lowering London’s foodprint on the consumer side. To collect data, ninety-five community gardens in London were asked to circulate an online survey to their gardeners. In total, forty-eight community gardeners responded to the survey. These responses were complemented with semi-structured interviews held with community garden participants. The paper investigates London community gardeners’ food consumption patterns including food self-sufficiency, food shopping habits, dietary choices, and food waste management in terms of their carbon footprint. In addition, it verifies that the timespan of community garden participation is not an absolute indicator of low-carbon food consumption choices, despite its influence on certain changes. It also accounts for experiential and social learning as the two key aspects of community gardening that promote gardeners’ behavioural change, resulting in a lower foodprint in daily life. © 2017 The Institute of Urban Sciences.","Community gardens; food consumption patterns; food-related carbon footprint; pro-environmental behaviour change","12265934","","","2-s2.0-85017581415"

It enables an individual to act in a way that aligns with his or her professional values and priorities, and imparts resilience to situations in which one's actions are dissonant to these personal beliefs.There are challenges in professionalism teaching that relate to student engagement and faculty confidence in this area.However,these cannot be addressed without first defining the veterinary professional identity-in effect, the aim of professionalism teaching. In this article,existing identity models from the wider literature have been analyzed through a veterinary lens.This analysis was then used to construct a model of veterinary professional identity that incorporates the self (personal morals and values),social development (learning from the workplace environment),and professional behaviors.Individuals who form what we have termed self-environment-behavior connections are proposed to be able to use workplace learning opportunities to inform their identity development,such that environmental complexity does not obstruct the link between values and behaviors.Those who fail to connect with the environment in this way may perceive that environmental influences (e.g.,the client,financial limitations) are obstructive to enacting their desired identity, and they may struggle with decision making in complex scenarios. © 2019 AAVMC.","Identity; Professionalism; Resilience; Well-being","0748321X","","","2-s2.0-85066507503"

Institutionalized strategies are routine ways of addressing problems that become taken-for-granted in a society. Environmental problems constitute a collective action problem in that personal consumption often conflicts with collective interests. I test whether beliefs about environmental problems have a different impact on a person's pro-environmental behaviors, depending on how addressing collective action problems is institutionalized in their society. In particular, I use level of welfare targeting as an observable, organizational difference among societies that reflects different institutionalized strategies for addressing a prominent collective action problem. I use multilevel models on data from the 2010 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and measures of welfare targeting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to answer this question. I find that in societies where the institutionalized strategy for dealing with inequality is highly targeted, individuals’ beliefs that these problems are important, real, and whether they can do something about them have a greater impact on their actions. The results suggest individuals generalize taken-for-granted strategies of assuring collective welfare to implement their individual beliefs about the environment, making institutional environments important moderators of the strength of the belief-action relationship. © 2018","Comparative; Environment; Institutions; Multi-level models","0049089X","","SSREB","2-s2.0-85050192563"

A stepwise analysis was then conducted to identify the main significant effects. The explorative and stepwise analyses confirmed that nationality is significant when explaining individual eco-behaviour, for both Italian and Chinese people.

We focus on the role of Majority World migrants to the Minority World. Large-scale survey research into EVKB is beginning to consider both ethnicity and migration history as important variables, but tends to leave the concepts of environment and environmental behaviour unexamined. Western EVKB indicators thus tend to be universalized rather than understood as themselves culturally specific. An emergent literature attempts to improve both quantitative and qualitative research on EVKB by broadening the conceptualization of environmental behaviour to include the practices of Majority World migrants. Those studies throw new light on the process of acculturation as having disruptive or solidifying potential for sustainable practices. We summarize four implications for future research. There is a need to go beyond western logics in research design and method. Straightforward assumptions about the ‘pro’ in pro-environmental behaviour need to be challenged. Cases of EVKB’s persistence post-migration and positive influence on the broader population should be sought out and examined.

A theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework was used incorporating moral norms and environmental identity, which have been previously implicated in explaining pro-environmental actions.

We argue that the form of analysis that develops, which we call Realist Bourdieusian Analysis, reveals more about the causal properties of the social formations entrepreneurial workers navigate than analyses that are limited within each lexicon. Arguably, combining Bourdieusian analysis and critical realism enriches our understanding of the constituent parts of economic fields, the resources entrepreneurial workers access through them, and agents’ relations, experiences and reflexive struggles. This novel approach, we argue, facilitates deeper appreciation of these workers’ experiences and more insightful critique of existing supports to entrepreneurship, as well as the possibility of prescribing policy supports that might enable workers within the field studied.

Therefore, this study demonstrates pathways to sustainable supply chain triple bottom line performance derived from linkages of institutional pressures (IP) and organizational identity (OI) to environment and social sustainable practices. It shows that the superordinate goal of sustainable supply chain management is met in spite of unyielding external pressures and desirable OI driving the unequivocal environmental and responsible social practices of firms. A survey approach was adopted to gather the data required for this study. A total of 118 completed questionnaires were received from respondents, who were managers and senior executives in supply chain management (SCM) in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM) version 3.0. Our findings showed that all hypothesized relationships are significant except both process- and market-based social practices could not directly impact economic performance. This is in sharp contrast to environmental practices. However, the significant linkage between social practices and social performance is a pathway for the former to economic performance. Therefore, the economic benefits derived from social practices are salvaged through its performance outcomes. The novel and useful impact of institutional pressures on sustainable supply chain practices are also unearthed. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic benefits; Environment; Social; Sustainable supply chain management","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85051103168"

In particular, we consider an initiative that requires all banks to base their loan decisions on corporate environmental performance. This is an important issue since it is globally gaining popularity to leverage bank loans as an avenue to enforce corporate environmental responsibility. Moreover, there are only a handful of empirical investigations in relation to the impacts of credit constraint on corporate environmental behaviors and strategies. This research also provides useful insights on how to enhance environmental regulation enforcement, using the Environmental Protection Bureau in partnership with local banks to exert a creditable threat of financial constraint on unfavorable environmental outcomes. Using the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences analysis, we find that this policy has significantly motivated firms, particularly those firms with a higher dependence on external financing, to reduce water pollution. We further discover that the policy compels firms to favor pollution prevention at the source instead of end-of-pipe treatments, since the policy imposes a long-term credit constraint on pollution. © 2019 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management","","02768739","","","2-s2.0-85063938024"

Further, because men and women have been socialized within particular cultures, gender differences may exist in trendsetting, creative traits and behaviors, and pro-environmental behaviors. Trendsetters have characteristics that are interrelated with creative traits and behaviors, perhaps inclining them to endorse pro-environmental behaviors. However, the interrelationships among these variables remain unexplored. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine these three variables among college students in South Korea and the United States (U.S.), specifically looking at cultural and gender differences. Participants were 225 Korean college students and 221 U.S. college students. Questionnaires included demographic items and scales measuring trendsetting, creative traits and behaviors, and pro-environmental behaviors.

Almost 90% of our respondents self-identified as environmentalists–no doubt reflecting their participation in EE programmes. However, low levels of reported environmental behaviours raised questions about what it meant to identify as an environmentalist in Indonesia. We explored students’ understanding of environmental issues at local, national and international levels; what they thought they could do about these issues; the perceived barriers to solving the problems; and who was responsible for solving the problems. Students identified waste/rubbish as the main problem locally, but were not well informed about environmental issues nationally and internationally. They are vague about how to ameliorate environmental problems, reflecting the weakness of EE in problem-solving. They never identified consumption as a problem. According to students, ‘society’–rather than governments, industry or consumers–is responsible for addressing environmental problems, but they identified society’s lack of environmental knowledge, care and awareness as the main barriers to solving environmental problems. © 2018, © 2018 Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.","Environmental awareness; environmental behaviour; environmentalist identity; Indonesia; school students","13639811","","","2-s2.0-85053243562"

We further argue that generalized trust can temper this fear because it allows people to expect others to contribute. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the concern-behavior association is stronger among individuals and societies with higher levels of trust. Findings from multilevel analyses on two international survey datasets (World Values Survey and International Social Survey Programme) support our hypothesis. These findings not only elucidate the concern-behavior gap but also suggest how environmental campaigns can be improved.

Therefore, it is important to know which factors are related to emissions. However, most studies so far have focused on income, household size and other structural factors while neglecting the potential relevance of attitudinal variables such as environmental concern. Those studies that did examine environmental attitudes were mostly based on “intent-oriented” measures of pro-environmental behavior instead of actual environmental impacts. The present study brings these lines of research together by analyzing the relationship between emissions, income and environmental attitudes within a framework of multivariate analysis. Furthermore, three specific emissions domains – mobility, housing and food – are analyzed separately and the results are compared to those based on a scale of pro-environmental behavior. All analyses are based on data from a large representative general population survey, the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007 (n = 3369), and a subsequent life cycle analysis.

While past research has found that women participate in higher levels of PEB compared to men cross-nationally, the variation in this gender gap across national contexts has yet to be explained. The question driving this research is: what is the context in which environmental responsibility is most feminized? I address this question by conducting a quantitative cross-national analysis of gender differences in PEB using International Social Survey Programme 2010 data on 30 countries. As expected, women report greater involvement in PEB than men in the vast majority of countries analyzed. The gender gap is not only explained by women’s greater levels of reported environmental concern than men in these countries, but also by a country’s level of market liberalization and ratio of female to male labor force participation. This research contributes cross-national quantitative evidence to support arguments emerging from qualitative literature suggesting a relationship between political-economic context and the feminization of environmental responsibility. In general, this research illuminates the complex relationships between environmental solutions and social justice and suggests a connection between processes of neoliberalism, gender equity, and sustainability. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cross-national; Environmental behavior; environmentalism; gender; ISSP","23251042","","","2-s2.0-85050759722"

Twenty people were interviewed about what they thought should be done to reduce the degree of climate change. Three main themes in their responses are identified: (1) representations of climate change; (2) responsibility for action; and (3) opposing environmental and economic interests. Overall, there was support for a variety of climate change mitigation strategies. There was some emphasis on individual behavior change combined with suggestions about greater information provision and the importance of personal choice. Although some participants criticized economic and profit-oriented structures, there was a strong sense among participants that change in this regard was unlikely. An expansion of examples of alternative strategies to address climate change could contribute towards transcending individualized approaches and accentuate perceptions of possibilities for significant social change. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Individualization; Mitigation strategies; Public perception; Responsibility","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85046076568"

Based on previous research, we hypothesised that a sense of collective efficacy on climate change would mediate the relationship between a set of independent variables and pro-environmental consumer and civic actions as follows: education and income might influence individual agency, political persuasion might influence individual inclination, trust in institutions and community involvement relate to social capital and hence scope for collective action.

We addressed the question of, “what, then, does influence environmental behavior?” by asking more specifically: what factors mediate the relationship between learning about environmentally related issues and engaging in environmentally related behaviors? Following Yin’s case study approach, we designed a California (USA)-based case study focused on four everyday-life activities: purchasing food, commuting, engaging in leisure activities, and interacting with mobile technology. We grounded the study in four propositions that previous sociological, psychological, and learning sciences research suggested might influence learning–behavior connections in complex everyday-life contexts. To address the propositions across the four cases, we conducted 197 short, semi-structured interviews grounded in a narrative, relational frame. Using thematic content analysis, we found support for three of our propositions as mediators of learning–behavior connections; we also uncovered two emergent themes. Our findings suggest a web of elements that affect learning–behavior connections; those elements offer insights for environmentally related programming. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Community; food; interpersonal; social learning; transportation","13504622","","","2-s2.0-85057878158"

A few studies provided support for the theory in explaining pro-environmental behaviour in Europe and Latin America. Beyond these studies, the question remains to what extent the VBN theory can also explain pro-environmental beliefs, norms, and behaviour in other cultures. This study tests the VBN theory in Japan and demonstrates that, as expected, the more people endorse biospheric values, the stronger they believe that car use has negative environmental impacts, the more they feel responsible for the problems caused by car use, and the more they feel personally obliged to reduce their car use. In contrast, stronger hedonic and, to a lesser extent, stronger egoistic values were related to less strong pro-environmental beliefs and norms. Furthermore, support was found for the mediation effects of pro-environmental beliefs in the relationships between hedonic and biospheric value orientations and norms. The VBN theory explained the acceptability and expected effects of a car pricing policy on an individual's transport choices, but less strongly than in previous studies. Interestingly, biospheric and hedonic values not only predicted adjacent beliefs, but also other beliefs and norms farther down the causal chain, suggesting that values play an important role in promoting sustainable mobility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Car use; Policy acceptability; Values; VBN theory","13698478","","","2-s2.0-85040311610"

In an era when the rights of persons with disabilities have been enshrined in international and national laws, such frameworks have become a necessity. Within the province of Quebec, Canada, the Disability Creation Process (DCP) model has served such a role. Furthermore, recent efforts to enrich the model enhance the applicability of this powerful tool to a broader range of contexts. As a result, the DCP model could be used more widely than it is today. In this paper we provide the foundations of the approach encapsulated by the model and explain how its usage guides policy development and service delivery within the province of Quebec.

Research shows that residents who are attached to their place of residence are more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior and, consequently, place attachment has been prescribed as a pro-environmental policy. However, previous research has not explored which specific aspect of place attachment is most effective at promoting different types of pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, in the context of big cities which typically host both natives and migrants, different resident groups may be attached to their places of residence due to different reasons. This implies that different types of place attachment policies may be required for each group of residents. Using survey data in Beijing, China, we find that the social bonding dimension of place attachment is most effective at promoting pro-environmental behavior and that this relationship is stronger for native born residents and those with longer residency length. We also find that the effect of place social bonding is stronger for high-effort than low-effort pro-environmental behavior. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of place attachment policies for local authorities in Beijing and in other big cities where different groups of residents cohabit. Generally, our research results imply that place attachment policies that focus on promoting social connections amongst urban residents to their place of residence will be most effective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Place attachment; Place social bonding; Pro-environmental behaviors","02642751","","","2-s2.0-85051542409"

Methodology: The leading methods for the study of this problem are the methods of questioning and testing, allowing to make a qualitative analysis of the students' attitude to the new environmental practice – ethical consumption and contributing to a more detailed identification of such issues as: knowledge of students about ethical consumption; students' attitude to separate waste disposal; students' attitude to the use of environmental packaging products; identification of students' practices of secondary consumption. Results: The article deals with the theoretical and methodological foundations of the analysis of students' attitudes to ethical consumption as a new environmental practice. It is established that the level of students' awareness of ethical consumption is low. The proportion of informed students among social and humanities specialties is twice more than high as students of technical specialties. It is revealed that more than a third of respondents do not know about the production of environmentally friendly goods. Almost all students are aware of the separate disposal of garbage and believe that it is necessary to install the appropriate bins. More than half of students are ready to sort garbage in the presence of such containers, and the readiness of humanitarians is 1.5 times higher than that of students of technical specialties. The main reasons why respondents would not buy goods in eco-friendly packaging are the lack of funds and the lack of sense for students. The majority of students believe the practice of secondary consumption to be popular one. Applications of this study: The data obtained in the work can be used in environmental psychology, social psychology, pedagogy, the psychology of education, age psychology, sociology, as well as for further theoretical development of this issue. Novelty/Originality of this study: The originality of this article lies in the analysis of the social phenomenon of ethical consumption, which implies that only purchase and consumption of those goods, the production of which does not cause great harm to the environment, those goods in the production of which are not infringed the rights of the worker and moreover child labor is not used, and most importantly the recycling of waste after consumption of the product will not harm nature is ethical one. © Baranov et al.","Environmental practices; Ethical behavior; Students","23956518","","","2-s2.0-85075016598"

Further, the measurement of environmental worldviews is often used instrumentally to engender pro-environmental behaviors, proving problematic both theoretically and pragmatically. Three dimensions are suggested to better explain the diversity of contemporary environmentalism—view of technology, view of societal response, and view of nature.

Then, the divide is disentangled into administrative and spatial components. The administrative component evaluates the effectiveness of the strategic policies set by the regional authority and their implementation by municipalities. The spatial component captures the presence of spatial contagion effect and considers citizens’ pro-environmental behaviours. The main results show that Sardinia has achieved better performance because of its advantages of extrinsic motivations, citizens’ pro-environmental attitudes, local institutional quality, and synergy between citizens and local governments. In Sicily, the weakness of local institutions makes citizens’ participation difficult and generates citizens’ indifference towards environmental issues, explaining most of the failures in the regional waste management. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Local governments; Pro-environmental behaviours; RIF regression; Separate waste collection; Spillover effects","18644031","","","2-s2.0-85062892036"

Many studies have related environmental behavior to personal characteristics such as environmental knowledge and attitude or to national policies such as environmental taxes and regulations. Few studies have looked at how regional factors affect residents' environmental behaviors, particularly for China. This is a substantive gap in the literature regarding the effects of regional governments on resident behavior at a closer distance via different mechanisms than the national government. This paper examines determinants of individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB) in terms of regional attributes as well as personal characteristics in China. For this purpose, we applied a multi-level regression model that regresses the degree of PEB on both individual and regional level factors, using Chinese General Social Survey data and the China Environment Yearbook data for the year 2010. The analysis shows that environmental attitude, willingness to pay for the environment, objective and subjective environmental knowledge, and environmental risk perception all promote PEB at the individual level. These results are in line with the existing literature on environmental behavior. In addition, at the regional level, environmental budgets, administrative enforcement, and economic development have positive impacts on resident PEB, while environmental pollution has a negative effect. Specifically, the levels of regional economic development and administrative enforcement not only directly affect behavior, but also indirectly affect behavior by controlling the influence of individual level variables. This means that the relationships between individual level variables and environmental behavior can be changed by regional contextual factors. These results suggest that regional government efforts for the environment can effectively promote PEB. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Cross-level interactions; Multi-level analysis; Pro-environmental behavior; Regional factors","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85054563536"

We base our explorations on life-history interviews to understand how the imaginaries of production are embedded in people’s self-conceptions. We identify seven barriers to the implementation of environmental practices: deficient regulations, collusion between controller and controlled, de-prioritisation, hierarchism, compartmentalisation, specialisation, and social unsustainability. A “necessity discourse,” legitimating the priority of efficiency and product quality over environmental sustainability, subjugates alternative sustainable practices.

Results from this study could contribute towards the development of appropriate strategies for the two age groups of farmers who respond to the different determinants of their pro-environmental behaviors. © 2018 by the authors.","Farmers; Pro-environmental behaviors; Social Attribution Theory; Sustainable agriculture; Taiwan","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85049197235"

The intention was to obtains ideas and solutions elaborated in various parts of the world implemented in local communities and to give special meaning to progressive proposals of international social movement contesting globalisation. This approach could certainly be beneficial in terms of the diffusion of good environmental practices or spreading civil society ideas in developing countries. However, when global ideas reach local ground, they remain global ideas, and sometimes very foreign ones, which may take over or eclipse local concepts in unintended or less-than-ideal ways. Occasionally, this approach could even lead to overpowering what is local instead of empowering it. Therefore, having the empowerment of local communities in mind, we propose that those who really contest globalisation of the neoliberal narrative should turn the tables and work to ""Think Locally, Act Globally."" Thinking locally and acting globally helps to ensure that adequate attention will be paid to local needs and local ideas. Presently, no local community exists outside of the global context and its influences, which affects the writings of contemporary sociologists who tend to emphasise the concept of ""place"" when analysing local communities. The nature of bonds on the local level changes in the globalised world, as local communities become more goal-oriented, utilising the functional proximity of people and other assets of the community. These new types of communities emerge even in places previously recognised as being shaped by local customs and traditions. These changes can be seen in the rural, semi-rural and small-town communities of Zalipie and Dąbrowa Tarnowska in Małopolska, as well as Radzionków in Silesia and in the nationwide study of rural communities in Poland. Their potential as the communities of the new type can be recognised as matching with neo-endogenous and sustainable development concepts. © 2018 Nicolaus Copernicus University.","globalisation; glocality; local community of the new type; neoendogenous development; place; sustainable development","12328855","","","2-s2.0-85064233479"

Findings suggest that residents’ attachment to their neighborhood through social ties and ties to the natural environment drives their engagement in water resource protection. Residents who are attached to their neighborhood through social ties are likely to be civically engaged in water resource protection. Further, residents’ perceived collective efficacy and their concern about stormwater are significant predictors of civic engagement in water.

Even though its seriousness seems to be common knowledge among the public, the reaction of individuals to it has been slow and uncertain. Many studies assert that simply knowing about climate change is not enough to generate people’s behavioural response. They claim, indeed, that in some cases scientific literacy can even obstruct behavioural response instead. However, recent surveys show a rather poor understanding of climate dynamics and argue that lack of knowledge about causal relationships within climate dynamics can hinder behavioural response, since the individual is not able to understand his/her role as causal agent and therefore doesn’t know how to take proper action. This study starts from the hypothesis that scientific knowledge focused on clarifying climate dynamics can make people understand not only dynamics themselves, but also their interactive relationship with the environment. Teaching materials on climate change based on such considerations were designed and implemented in a course for secondary-school students with the aim of investigating whether this kind of knowledge had an influence on students’ willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviours. Questionnaires were delivered for testing the effect of the teaching experience on knowledge and behaviour. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Causal knowledge; climate change; science education; secondary-school students; willingness to change behaviour","09500693","","","2-s2.0-85026501045"

We examine three distinct sets dependent variables measuring water conservation behaviors that require differing levels of individual investment. These variables measure behaviors that require no financial investment (such as shorter showers), minimal financial investment (low-flow fixtures), and larger financial investment (new appliances). We use a multilevel statistical regression to determine if a relationship exists between local levels of drought and individual water conservation behavior. Our primary finding is that individuals who live in counties that experience drought have a higher tendency to make behavioral changes to conserve water and make small financial investments to conserve water. We find no relationship between local water scarcity and larger financial investments to conserve water. Overall, results suggest that individuals’ environmental behaviors may be closely connected to their local environmental context as long as significant financial investment is not required. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coupled human-natural systems; drought; natural resources; sustainability; water conservation","23251042","","","2-s2.0-85053490878"

However, not all parts of the archipelago are equally affected. The main part of the island of Palawan in the country’s south west is rather unlikely to be hit by a strong storm, which is why its inhabitants don’t fear very harmful typhoons. At the same time, however, they consider climate change and its adverse effects as a serious threat, and very destructive cyclones like super typhoon Yolanda in 2013 are well understood as intensified by climate change. In this article I will resolve this apparent contradiction. By means of cognitive anthropological methods, I will demonstrate how the scientific discourse on global climate change and thus scientific climate knowledge is incorporated in, and intertwined with pre-existing local ecological knowledge and ubiquitous national and local discourses about the environment. As the presented empirical data indicates, there exists a widespread conviction within the island’s capital that environment-friendly behaviour mitigates extreme weather events as much as morally bad environmental behaviour induces all kinds of natural hazards, including climate change. Therefore, Palawan serves as a good example to show how the located (re)production of scientific climate change knowledge, its local communication, and its entanglements with other forms of cultural knowledge eventually shape the way people perceive and make sense of climate change. © 2018, Duncker and Humblot GmbH.

We carried out an empirical comparison using data from the 2013 version of the Chinese General Social Survey. The results showed that public sector and state-owned enterprise affiliations were both positive predictors of environmental behaviors.

Results show that basic public service is an important factor influencing PEB. Basic public service consists of three areas. Of these areas, basic education and life security exert a significant promotional effect on PEB. Furthermore, basic public service also can moderate the relationship between individual factors and PEB. The multi-level theoretical framework provides a systematic perspective for further research into PEB. The findings also offer researchers a beneficial reference for analyzing behavioral change.

However, we also find that many of their chosen conservation practices required little to no sacrifice, and in addition to benefiting the environment, were also cost-minimizing business decisions. We find that as a group, these farmers’ beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are largely focused on productive efficiency. We argue that this focus often puts them in competition with other social groups, which ultimately reinforces group saliency and adversely affects relations between farmers and other groups seeking to influence farming practices. © 2019, Society for Human Ecology.

What is the cognitive process at the base of this learning mechanism? The present paper is a pilot work investigating the dynamics of individual environmental knowledge on the basis of social capital theory. Using Tsai and Ghoshal’s findings, a well known framework widely accepted in organizational studies which supports the existence of a relationship between structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of social capital, and between social capital and knowledge exchange, these dynamics are then tested in the context of environmental behaviour studies. The quantitative analysis is carried out by means of a structural equation model based on data collected in the Republic of Latvia. Results support main theoretical hypotheses, but several effects are found to be highly sensitive to control variables (residence place dimensions, ethnic affiliation, age, personal income), leading to hypothesise a strong dependency of environmental learning patterns on the socio-demographic, socio-economic and cognitive context. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Environmental learning; Latvia; micro level; social capital; structural equation modelling","13504622","","","2-s2.0-84980348141"

Undergraduate students are an interesting and novel population, as they are still forming their values and beliefs, and therefore may be more open to engage in sustainability efforts. This study assessed five sustainability behaviors: (a) support for political candidates who say they will strengthen environmental policies, (b) recycling, (c) electricity use, (d) food selection, and (e) transportation choices. Findings support the notion that one’s values matter in environmental decision-making, but that different values are associated with different behaviors. Those who adhere to biospheric and altruistic values were more likely to engage in a range of sustainability behaviors whereas those who adhere to egoistic values were less likely to engage in most behaviors.

Both are referred to as being dimensions of environmental concern. Multilevel SEM is conducted to explain country differences regarding levels of consistency between the two dimensions of environmental concern. The results of the multiple group confirmatory factor analysis show that it is possible to reach metric measurement invariance for both dimensions of environmental concern. Further, the consistency (i.e., the strength of statistical association) between these two dimensions differs considerably throughout the world. Multilevel SEM analysis shows that the consistency is associated with national wealth; that is, the higher the national wealth, the stronger the relationship between the two dimensions of environmental concern. Thus, in poor countries, there is only a weak link between environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions to protect the environment. In contrast, in wealthy countries, environmental attitudes and environmental behavioral intentions form a highly consistent cluster of environmental concern. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cross-national comparison; environmental concern; measurement equivalence; multilevel structural equation model; willingness to sacrifice for environmental protection","15579336","","","2-s2.0-85079156360"

While denouncing how environmentalist regimes reinforce gender inequalities, this literature has overlooked migrant domestic workers’ contributions to sustainable practices, such as managing household recyclables and waste. This article addresses the intersection of gender, race and immigration in urban recycling schemes in the city of Naples, Italy, a growing destination for labor migrants and an area with a long history of waste management crises. Through in-depth interviews, the author examines how migrant domestic workers sustain recycling efforts, in their homes and workplaces. These narratives show how precarious immigration and employment statuses push migrant workers to take on burdensome recycling work for their employers. Despite concerns of street harassment and xenophobia, findings further show how contributing to neighborhood recycling efforts are also important ways in which migrant women express their commitment to the local community. These findings broaden existing notions of gender inequalities in environmental governance through an intersectional framework focusing on precarious migrant labor. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Gender; intersectionality; migration; social reproduction; sustainability","13505068","","","2-s2.0-85040715344"

However, no attention has been paid to a plausibly reversal relation between the two, i.e., the effect of people’s life satisfaction on their environmental behaviors. As a result, the commonly recognized empirical findings might implicate some risks of biases and inaccuracy due to the present of the endogeneity complexity. To fill in this gap, this paper attempts to investigate whether there exists a causal effect of people’s life satisfaction on their pro-environmental behavior by utilizing an instrument variable model. In the process, a two stages least squares model was utilized for parameter estimation using a large dataset collected by China General Social Survey, and in meanwhile an unexpected length of sunshine hours was introduced as being an instrument variable. The results show that people’s life satisfaction indeed spurs their interest of participating in pro-environmental behavior. Consequently, an individual’s environmental concern poses a prime influential mechanism for one’s life satisfaction, and in turn the level of people’s satisfaction could exert a considerable influence to their environment behavior. Thus, improving the life well-being for the general public may turn into a spontaneous instrument in resolving the potential conflicts between economic growth and environment protection. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Environmental concern; IV probit model; Life satisfaction; Pro-environmental behavior","00335177","","","2-s2.0-85046784414"

We set out to assess the current state of knowledge in this field and provide a framework for analysing dimensions of relations to place and their links with environmental engagement. We systematically analysed the characteristics of 66 studies identified for: focus of research, location, methods, and findings, particularly whether relationships to place aided in environmental engagement. We also categorised the studies according to our dimensions of place relations framework, cultural and environmental contexts, and intensity of climate impacts experienced. The answer to our guiding research question–whether place attachment was an effective way to communicate with people about climate change and get them actively engaged with it–was yes (74.2%), but with considerable variation according to these characteristics and dimensions. Based on this analysis, we identify gaps in current research and suggest critical paths for future research, especially in terms of geography and demography because of their implications for justice and equity in the processes of climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Public awareness of marine environmental threats and conservation efforts was assessed through comparison with the, assumed well informed, professional sample. Findings suggest that the public are generally well informed of threats to the marine environment, but are significantly less well informed about marine conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, despite indicating concern for the marine environment, members of the public display significantly fewer pro-environmental behaviours than marine conservation professionals.

Using a study based on 232 usable questionnaires from EMAS-registered organizations, we explored the influence of institutional pressures from different stakeholders and the role of corporate strategy in the “substantial” versus “symbolic” integration of environmental practices. The results highlighted that although institutional pressures generally strengthen the internalization of proactive environmental practices, the influence of stakeholders can either support the integration of these practices or encourage their superficial adoption. For example, while pressure from suppliers and shareholders contribute to corporate greening, pressure from customers and industrial associations tend to encourage greenwashing (i.e., the superficial and misleading adoption of environmental practices). Product quality-oriented strategies also positively influence EMS internalization. The paper sheds light on the institutional complexity underlying the substantial versus symbolic implementation of environmental practices, and questions the dominant isomorphic view of EMS adoption.

However, this gender gap is rarely seen as problematic; environmental sociologists have referred to household-level pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) as ‘low-hanging fruit’ in the pursuit of ecological sustainability–actions that are easy to adopt and reduce environmental impact. To date, environmental sociologists have neglected to ask how women’s higher rate of engagement in these behaviours relates to women’s outcomes more generally. In this article, we draw on past literature within and beyond environmental sociology to develop a theoretical approach for future research on the gender gap in PEB. We also use descriptive statistical analyses of cross-national survey data to demonstrate our argument. Not only do we show that women’s engagement in PEB is tied to her economic status in ways that are distinct from men’s engagement in PEB, we see that this difference persists across varying household arrangements of paid work. Understanding this as evidence of a gendered relationship between household PEB and economic status, we recommend future directions of research. Given that household environmental protection is a gendered practice, we feel environmental sociologists are poised to make important contributions to research on gender. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","economic status; environmentalism; Gender; pro-environmental behavior; women’s status","23251042","","","2-s2.0-85050774833"

First, it argues that there is an analytical and empirical need to consider “land–water” as a coupled resource, particularly in coastal riverine landscapes. In coastal Tanzania, this bundling has occurred through the everyday agro-ecological practices of local resource users, as well as their historical struggles against postcolonial state policies. Second, it argues that the contentious land–water politics in Bagamoyo illustrate the dialectic of nation-building in postcolonial Africa, namely, the contradiction between the state’s need for capital accumulation in the global economy via resource extraction on the one hand and political legitimation in the nation-state among the rural majority on the other. © 2018, © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.","agrarian political economy; enclosure; historical political ecology; land–water; Tanzania","24694452","","","2-s2.0-85055495776"

Maintaining lawns to fulfill aesthetic norms has environmental consequences. In this analysis, we examine household decisions to apply nitrogen-containing lawn fertilizer. Using survey data of 298 households in Nashville, Tennessee, we first examine the prevalence of fertilizer use and the rate of annual nitrogen applied. We find that the resulting distribution is skewed, with the top 20% of the sample applying 56% of the total share of nitrogen. In contrast to this subset of “intensive” fertilizers, 93% of households applied at or below levels recommended by landscaping professionals, challenging the assumption that the over-application of fertilizer is widespread. We employed multi-level modeling to examine the relative importance of household- and block-level characteristics on fertilizer use and the intensity of use. Consistent with prior work, we find that the desire for a green lawn is a significant predictor of fertilizer use. However, we also find that living on a wealthy block and living near others who value a green lawn independently predict fertilizer use. In addition, we observe that intensive fertilizing households tend to be less wealthy than others on their block, suggesting the possibility of an aspirational dimension to fertilizer use. Finally, we find evidence that environmental concern is associated with less intensive fertilizer use, suggesting that households may be willing to take some steps to mitigate the impact of their lawn care on the environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental behavior; Fertilizer; Landscape preferences; Nitrogen; Residential lawns; Urban ecology","01692046","","LUPLE","2-s2.0-85047945480"

The study used descriptive research design. Primary data was collected through an online survey method to capture managerial perceptions of how their companies are dealing with environmental issues. A total of 162 responses, received from managers in departments such as sustainability, Environmental Health and Safety, Corporate Social Responsibility, and general functions, were analyzed. The cluster analysis revealed three clusters. Cluster one represents environmentally proactive companies showing very high values on voluntary practices; whereas cluster two represents reactive companies exhibiting very low values on the voluntary practices. Cluster three is categorized as beginners’ category exhibiting satisfactory performance on the traditional practices but poor on the adoption of voluntary environmental practices.

Primary and secondary teachers are environmentally conscious, but they lack knowledge of fundamental concepts of environmental literacy. Effective environmental education in schools requires environmental literacy in teachers. Teachers are responsible to provide their students with knowledge, values, attitudes, and skills needed to preserve the environment in order to produce environmentally literate citizens. The latter is possible if teachers themselves have high levels of environmental knowledge, strong environmental awareness, and manifest environmental behavior. In response, this study aimed to assess Greek in-service teachers' environmental knowledge, eco-friendly behavior, and their connectedness to nature and environmental identity as aspects of their environmental consciousness. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess teachers' demographic profile, environmental knowledge, and self-reported environmental behavior. Two well-established measures of general environmental attitudes—connectedness to nature and environmental identity scales—were also used. The method lies on principal component analysis and evaluation of Cronbach's alpha to confirm the reliability and validity of the scales. The results showed that teachers' scores on both scales were high, revealing their positive attitudes in terms of the environment. Responders possess a moderate level of environmental knowledge and they possess pro-environmental behavior. Results from this study can be useful to policy makers in order to design and promote the implementation of teachers' training programs in Greece and other countries of the European Union that focus on the enhancement of their environmental literacy.

Five themes emerged from the interviews: erosion of science research capacity, resulting limitations in understanding risk, declining influence on policy and regulation, redirection of public science funds to support the private sector, and the need to broaden the science knowledge base. The Canadian death of evidence controversy represents a challenge to science and technology studies (STS) scholars who wish to maintain a critical and reflexive perspective on the scientific enterprise without supporting attacks on evidence. While subsequent Canadian governments may simply return science to an unreflexively privileged knowledge status, we view this as equally damaging to broad risk calculation and democratic science. We suggest instead that a broader gathering of matters of concern will always be essential to risk assessment. © The Author(s) 2018.","development; environmental practices; governance; markets/economies; politics; power; risk; science and technology studies","01622439","","","2-s2.0-85048873430"

Using insights from Grid-group cultural theory and cognitive sociology, this mixed-methods study examined the factors that influence pro-environmental behavior among a nationally representative US sample (n = 395). Qualitative results indicate that individuals develop culturally-specific environmental socio-cognitive schemas which they use to assign meaning to the environment and guide their environmentally significant behavior. Quantitative results indicate cultural orientation, pro-environmental orientation, environment identity, and environmental influence predict pro-environmental behavior.

Using social-cognitive theory, we examine how three forms of environmental concern—egoistic (e.g., concern for oneself; one's health or life), social-altruistic (e.g., concern for others; future generations or country), and biospheric (e.g., concern for plants and animals; nature)—influence concurrent ecological stress and ecological coping strategies. Further, we examine how ecological stress and coping are associated with both depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. In an online survey of 342 U.S. adults we found unique patterns of the three forms of environmental concern. Only individuals higher in biospheric environmental concern perceived ecological stress and engaged in ecological coping. In contrast, individuals higher in social-altruistic concern did not perceive ecological stress, but did engage in ecological coping. Those higher in egoistic concern neither perceived ecological stress, nor engaged in coping. In addition, perceived ecological stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms; ecological coping negatively predicted depressive symptoms, while positively predicting pro-environmental behaviors. In sum, with the exception of those high in biospheric concern, study participants did not seem to perceive climate change threats as having a profound effect on their own or their family's life. Differentiating three forms of environmental concern provides a nuanced view on their association with ecological stress and coping, and in turn depressive symptoms and pro-environmental behaviors. Results indicate that current public policy approaches that often focus on the natural environment when depicting or explaining the effects of climate change, may limit the effectiveness of interventions to those people who already show high concern for all living creatures, while failing to affect those motivated by egoistic or altruistic concern, increasing the risks associated with delaying climate change adaptation and the potential for large-scale negative mental health effects in our society. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change beliefs; Climate change threats; Depressive symptoms; Ecological coping; Ecological stress; Environmental concern; Pro-environmental behaviors; Psychological adaptation","09593780","","GECHE","2-s2.0-85037029307"

Mixed-model analyses of SVI for the period 2012-2017 confirmed these results by showing both decrease in equalitarian values SVI and no change in non-equalitarian values SVI after 2015.

In this paper we present and apply a model that integrates perspectives from economics and communication sciences to address the question of what happens to pro-environmental behavior after the introduction and then the withdrawal of payment for environmental services (PES). In particular, we discuss the effects of financial incentives on social norms and the effects of norms on subsequent behavior after incentives have ended. This is important because the dominant literature on PES lacks a sophisticated understanding of social norms and fails to address what will happen to behavior once payments end. That literature addresses the potential problem that payments can crowd out or possibly crowd in intrinsic sources of motivation for pro-social behavior, but it lacks the sophisticated understanding of social norms that has the potential to help explain and address this phenomenon. We summarize experimental evidence based on our model showing that introducing a financial incentive for behavior change can change social norms around that behavior. These norms, in turn, can continue to influence behavior even after incentives have ended. PES programs can address this situation by actively evoking existing social norms in favor of conservation. © 2017 by the authors.","Interdisciplinary; Motivation crowding; Payment for ecosystem services; Social norms","20711050","","","2-s2.0-85029498910"

The aim of this study was to determine how the setting and cognitive or attitudinal factors explain pro-environmental behavior in the context of small water restoration in an urban–rural setting. We compared the results from three primary contingent valuation (CV) surveys in Finland conducted in different geographical locations: the urban capital region of Helsinki, the peri-urban Kalimenjoki river basin area, and the rural Koillismaa area of northeastern Finland. According to the results, it appears that instead of an urban–rural dichotomy, the willingness to participate in pro-environmental actions by donating money or carrying out voluntary work might be determined by place-related local factors that either motivate or discourage participation in environmental work. Awareness of the local obstacles and drivers for the restoration of watercourses might make it easier to accomplish projects in the future and help in allocating budget funding to the areas where public willingness to participate is limited. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Place attachment; Public participation; Stream restoration; Urban–rural setting; Water framework directive (WFD); Willingness to pay (WTP)","14629011","","ESCPF","2-s2.0-85049311626"

Given this argument, we ask: how do we cultivate the potential for virtuous cycles to confer resilience in social–ecological systems? To answer this question, we review feedback mechanisms and identify virtuous cycles catalyzed via ecological restoration to highlight their importance to the resilience of social–ecological systems. We then conceptualize these cycles with a causal map (also known as a causal loop diagram) illustrating an example where restoration activities and civic ecology practices contributed to feedbacks and virtuous cycles.

As a precursor to looking at how such policies can be supported, our research questions whether environmental attitudes are congruent with work time patterns and preferences. Our initial hypothesis was that those who care most for the environment would work fewer hours than those who exhibit lower levels of environmental concern, and prefer to do so. However, contra our expectations, our empirical analysis of the European Social Survey shows that those who state they care most about the environment are more likely to work longer hours, and prefer to do so. Overall, men tend to be less concerned about the environment, and work longer. Caring responsibilities, in contrast, fall disproportionately on women. We argue that this reflects traditional gender roles that are a residual from the social norm of the male breadwinner model. Given work time reduction as an environmental policy, the task is to influence preferences and ‘green’ human behaviour, especially among men. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental behaviour; environmental sustainability; feminist economics; preferences; Work time reduction","09538259","","","2-s2.0-85060987616"

Primary values emphasised included “environmental justice” and “stewardship.” Analysis of the data indicated that groups in this network are distinctive in two particular ways: (1) group focus on mobilising values and environmental concern towards “community building” can produce what looks like a more conservative approach to climate change mobilisation, preserving and working slowly within institutional structures, with a primary focus not on climate change mitigation per se but on the consolidation and development of the community and broader network; and (2) these groups can often under‐report their accomplishments and the footprint of their work on the basis of a common religious conviction which we have termed a “culture of modesty.”. © 2018 The Authors.

We explore whether programs lacking monitoring and enforcement mechanisms can curb participants' shirking with program obligations. Incentive-based approaches to policy see monitoring and enforcement as essential to curb shirking, while norm-based approaches view social mechanisms such as norms and learning as sufficient to serve this purpose. The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a prominent international voluntary program, encourages firms to adopt socially responsible policies. Its program design, however, relies primarily on norms and learning to mitigate shirking. Using a panel of roughly 3,000 U.S. firms from 2000 to 2010, and multiple approaches to address endogeneity and selection issues, we examine the effects of Compact membership on members' human rights and environmental performance. We find that members fare worse than nonmembers on costly and fundamental performance dimensions, while showing improvements only in more superficial dimensions.

I discuss how the requirements of the ESA, namely that decisions regarding the protection of endangered species must be made based “solely on the basis of the best scientific…data available,” have pushed people to reframe their cultural claims about the environment as scientific claims in order to gain legal authority. I argue that these animals span the social worlds of indigenous hunters and fishers, regulators, and ecological scientists. As such, they offer the opportunity to interrogate the relationships among ways of knowing the environment. I suggest that strict divisions among “types” of knowledge as well as hard-and-fast bonds between groups and “their” knowledge become problematic.

Eight constructs emerged that informed our understanding of distributed leadership dimensions within the low-carbon city framework: vision, organizational framework, organizational culture, consensus, instructional programs, expertise, team leader leadership, and team member leadership. The evidence shows that there is a positive relationship between distributed leadership and the outcome of the low-carbon city agenda, and that a dispersed pattern in distributing leadership is required to enhance community engagement.

Their awareness of the marine environment will therefore have a significant effect upon sustainable marine development. This study examines Taiwanese university students’ marine environmental awareness, focusing on environmental attitudes, understanding of marine and coastal issues, and environmental behavior. A total of 825 valid samples in a questionnaire survey are used for the analysis. Overall, respondents possess a highly positive attitude towards the marine environment and a moderate self-reported level of marine knowledge, but are not actively engaged in environmental protection endeavors, particularly ones involving spending personal income and taking legal or political action. Experience in marine-related activities and marine knowledge are important in fostering marine environmental awareness, particularly in regard to environmental behavior. This study addresses the gap between widespread environmental concerns and low engagement in environmental actions by proposing a multimodal approach: improving marine knowledge and experience in marine-related activities, creating safe recreational spaces at seasides, and reinforcing legal education. This study concludes by highlighting the importance of marine environmental awareness in the development of ocean citizenship as well as the sustainability of the marine environment. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","awareness; marine environment; sustainability; Taiwan; university students","13504622","","","2-s2.0-84931858673"

Most studies have focused on young adults still residing in parental homes, neglecting that Generation Y (born between 1975 and 1991) has 'grown up'. The consumption patterns and environmental implications of their newly established households demand scholarly attention. Through a large-scale household sustainability survey, conducted in Australia, we have uncovered important inter-generational differences in environmental attitudes and everyday domestic practices. We found that generational cohorts hold distinct environmental attitudes. Younger households were most concerned with climate change, and least optimistic about future mitigation. However, generational differences influenced everyday domestic practices in more complex ways. All households engaged extensively with those 'pro-environmental' practices that reflected established cultural norms, government regulations and residential urban form. For other pro-environmental practices there were clear differences, with Generation Y households being the least engaged. A widening 'value-action gap' was apparent across our sample population, from oldest to youngest. However, rather than reflecting Generation Y's supposed hedonism, we argue that this gap reflects generational geographies: how lifecourse intersects with housing and labour markets and norms of cleanliness to shape everyday domestic practices. Our research illuminates the shortcomings of a one-size-fits-all approach to household sustainability. The young adult stage is a time of transition during which homes and independent lifestyles are established, and practices are altered or become entrenched, for better or worse. © 2015.","Consumption; Generation Y; Generational geographies; Lifecourse; Pro-environmental practices; Value-action gap","00167185","","","2-s2.0-84937239424"

The campaign emphasized educating participants on specific actions that reduce resource use and the relative environmental benefit of each action. Design/methodology/approach: This investigation used a pre-test–post-test design. At the beginning of an academic year, participants were invited to measure their baseline EF and take part in a footprint reduction campaign. At the end of the campaign, participants measured their EF again to see if they were able to reduce it by 10 per cent. Findings: Participants in the footprint reduction campaign decreased their EF by 10 per cent. Students changed behaviors related to goods and services the most, resulting in a 16 per cent decrease in footprint for this behavior category. The most significant behavior change for faculty and staff was in the housing category with footprint reductions of 12 and 11 per cent, respectively. The most common behavioral changes in students were low- and no-cost options. Research limitations/implications: Because of the general nature of the EF tool, estimates of resource use reduction are approximate. Data describing pro-environmental behaviors were self-reported by participants, making accuracy dependent on participant recollections. Originality/value: This paper illustrates how providing quantitative, personalized and university-specific knowledge on the impact of personal lifestyles on natural resources can facilitate significant, measurable pro-environmental behavioral change for the entire campus community.

The survey data have allowed an enriched understanding of both individual and structural level challenges as well as incentives towards improving environmental practices in relation to household food waste minimisation. The results indicated that, in keeping with other research in this area, food waste increases according to the number of individuals in a household, and in particular the number of younger people. Also, while the majority of participants were at least “somewhat concerned” about their households’ environmental impact, over three quarters of participant households put food waste into their rubbish bin. Some solutions and directions to further progress research, policy, and practice in this area are offered, and include the need for more direct and personalised communication regarding waste minimisation, along with the provision of kerbside food waste collections. It is clear that individual- or household-level changes are important and must be supported systemically by both local body and state level legislation and initiatives, if there is to be any substantial decline in food waste going to landfill. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","environment; food waste; Household waste; New Zealand; survey","13549839","","","2-s2.0-84924384818"

More recently, CSR has increasingly attracted governments’ attention, and is now promoted in public policy, especially in the European Union (EU). Conflicts can arise, however, when advanced welfare states introduce CSR into public policy. The reason for such conflict is that CSR leaves key public welfare issues to the discretion of private business. This voluntary issue assignment contrasts starkly with advanced welfare states’ traditions favoring negotiated agreements and strong regulation to control corporate conduct. This article analyzes the conflicts and compatibilities arising when advanced welfare states introduce CSR, focusing on how the two traditions diverge and on how conflicts are reconciled. Empirically the study focuses on four Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—widely recognized as the most advanced welfare states, and increasingly as leaders in CSR public policy. From interviews of 55 officials of government ministries, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and employer associations, the authors conclude that tension indeed exists between CSR public policies and advanced welfare state traditions in all four countries. Whereas CSR’s aims are compatible with Nordic institutional traditions, the means promoted in CSR is in conflict with such Nordic traditions as corporatist agreements and rights-based welfare state regulation of social and environmental issues. There is harmony of goals, but conflict in means between the four Nordic countries studied. © The Author(s) 2012.","business and political strategies; corporate social responsibility (CSR); politics; regulation","00076503","","","2-s2.0-84931461429"

This paper explores if a regionalisation of agri-environmental governance may contribute to overcome these criticisms. The paper empirically explores three regionalised agri-environmental schemes from Flanders, Belgium, with the use of 40 qualitative interviews with farmers and other relevant stakeholders. Building on the Bourdieusian theory of capital and the conceptual distinction between bonding and bridging social capital, the paper analyses whether and why the regionalised arrangements incited farmers to integrate environmental production in their farm management to meet other regional stakeholders’ demands for agri-environmental change. In doing so, the paper particularly focuses on the role of bridging social capital in fostering farmer participation in agri-environmental governance, which is a topic that—despite a growing scholarly recognition of the importance of social capital in mediating farmers’ environmental behaviour—has to date received scant conceptual and empirical attention. The paper reveals that farmers principally participated in the regionalised agri-environmental schemes to enhance the long-term viability of their agricultural businesses by building up more cooperative and appreciative, bridging social ties with other regional stakeholders. Notably, such participation is only likely to be substantive and lead to long-term, pro-environmental behaviour change of farmers, if farmers actually succeed in building up bridging social capital by receiving other regional stakeholders’ appreciation for their agri-environmental work. The paper ends with discussing the implications of these findings for the future design and implementation of socially and ecologically robust agri-environmental schemes. © 2016 The Author","Bonding social capital; Bourdieu; Cultural capital; Environmental policy; Flanders; The ‘Good farmer’","02648377","","","2-s2.0-84995495536"

On average, participants donated approximately 70% of the 10 euros to each charity but donated slightly more money (0.42 euros) for poverty reduction than animal protection. Interestingly, participants allocated the same amount of money to the first charity (whether for humans or animals), but their second allocation depended on the charity and indicated an anthropocentric bias (i.e., higher allocations to poverty reduction than animal protection). Women donated more for animal protection than men, and stronger pro-animal attitudes were associated with higher donations for animal protection. We also found a positive effect of a “social desirability” scale on incentivized donations. In sum, our study finds that participants gave more to humanitarian than animal charities.

The survey confirmed these results, but indicated a preference for such actions as recycling and reducing food waste in contrast to such alternatives as reducing meat consumption or avoiding processed foods. These results suggest that educational campaigns could focus on strengthening beliefs about the food-environment connection, as well as help to empower students to take a greater variety of actions to reduce their food-related environmental footprint.

Results obtained using the structural equation modeling approach support the proposed hypothesis that process management practices mediate the relationship between stakeholder pressure and environmental practice adoption.

The authors draw on the behavioural perspective model (BPM) of consumer behaviour and social capital theory in arguing that social capital shapes a consumer's knowledge of environmental issues and pro-environmental attitudes, which in turn influence a consumer's perceived capability to engage in eco-behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses partial least squares approach to structural equation modelling of survey data involving 1,044 consumers in the Philippines. It involves testing of a measurement model to examine the validity and reliability of the constructs used in the study. This is followed by testing of the structural models to test the hypothesised relationships of the constructs. Findings - The results suggest the substantive influence of social capital on environmental knowledge, pro-environmental attitudes and eco-capability. Both knowledge and attitudes have positive effects on eco-capability, which in turn positively shapes eco-behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Future studies can examine how social capital as a multi-dimensional construct impacts context-specific consumer behaviour. Practical implications - Social and environmental marketing may focus on social network activation to encourage eco-behaviours of consumers. Social implications - Findings highlight the role of social capital within one's community as a resource channel to encourage environmentally responsible consumer behaviour. Originality/value - The study extends the BPM by offering a social capital view as a more nuanced explanation of consumer eco-behaviour. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Consumer behaviour; Environment; Social capital; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable development","17471117","","","2-s2.0-84942102768"

Analyzing unique quantitative data on more than 1800 disclosure reports by corporations in more than 50 countries, this article presents two main findings. First, field-level factors are prominent but they influence disclosure levels in different ways. Third-party verification encourages greater disclosure, while peer organizations mitigate disclosure. Second, national and global factors influence disclosure differently in developed and developing countries. Business disclosure in developed countries is impacted by national factors while, in developing countries, disclosure is significantly influenced by global factors.

Communication technology increasingly plays a role in decision-making about health and environmental behaviors and is being leveraged to influence that process.

The concept of 'One Health' has emerged as a framework for interdisciplinary work that cuts across human, animal, and ecosystem health in recognition of their interdependence and the value of an integrated perspective. Yet, the science of communication, information studies, social psychology, and other social sciences have remained marginalized in this emergence.

Such deceptive practice leads to lure consumers to believe they are offering environmental friendly product. As such, this is necessary to make consumers aware about the issue concerning “greenwashing.” Considering this, the present paper aims to answer the following questions; (1) Why pro-environmental behaviour in the forefront? (2) Does eco-label will ensure the genuineness of environmental-friendly product? (3) Why greenwashing is a problem? (4) How to differentiate between the greenwashed and the real deal products? And (5) What is the role of marketers in this regard? Relevant literatures are reviewed to respond to the research questions. Since environmentally concerned consumers became a profitable market segment in recent years, many companies are moving towards eco-label. However, not all eco-friendly claims are genuine. Therefore, the increase of greenwashing, with deficiency of enforcements, contributes to consumer disbelief of all green claims. With that, it weakens the value of consumers as an inspiration to influence companies toward environmental friendly determination for industrial practices and business operations. It is expected that, the present study will contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge in regard to existing falls environmental claims regarding eco-labels. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Consumer awareness; Eco-labeling; Environmental-friendly product; Greenwashing; Pro-environmental behavior","19366612","","","2-s2.0-85021086241"

General awareness of the environmental consequences of car usage is high but fails to correspond to moderated car use. This paper contributes to an understanding of how university students’ environmental beliefs affect decisions to engage in continued car use (persistence) and/or to discontinue or reduce car use (desistance). The aim of the research presented here was to explore the range of neutralizations and counter-neutralizations (affirmations) employed by students and to examine the ways in which they are used to justify and maintain either persistence or desistance in car use. The research consisted of six focus group sessions with thirty-four UK-based Higher Education students. Analysis of the study's data highlights the range of neutralizations and counter-neutralizations employed by students in social settings. The article discusses the usefulness of neutralization theory in accounting for actual and/or intended non-environmentally friendly behaviour such as car use. In addition, the study's findings are discussed in relation to prior research and to potential implications for public policy interventions which favour moderating car usage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Car use justifications; Neutralization theory; Neutralizations and affirmations; Persistence and desistence; Travel behaviour; University students","09658564","","","2-s2.0-84989196115"

However, research suggests that these efforts can backfire by breeding despair, denial and inaction. This may be especially true among younger audiences, as despair is highest among those who view climate challenges as out of their control, and children generally have lower perceived and actual control than adults in political and personal arenas. Though many studies have documented feelings of despair and sadness among younger audiences, few have explored how climate change hope may counteract despair and encourage productive responses to climate change concern. This study examined how climate change hope, despair, and concern predict pro-environmental behavior with a quantitative survey of a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1486). We did not find an interaction between climate change hope and concern or despair, but instead found climate change hope and concern independently and positively related to behavior and despair negatively related to behavior. These results suggest that climate change concern among K-12 audiences may be an important antecedent to behavior which does not dampen the positive impacts of hope. Further, rather than mitigating the negative effects of climate change despair, hope may be an independent predecessor to behavior. Students at Title I (a measure of low socioeconomic status) schools were less likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, suggesting climate literacy efforts should target schools with lower levels of socioeconomic status specifically. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate action; Climate literacy; Concern; Hope; Pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-84956701449"

Although emissions from transport and construction sectors have experienced a temporary decrease due to the economic downturn, overall emissions are increasing. Despite this, there is a lack of baseline data on three key consumption areas that impact significantly on the environment: water, transport and energy. To address this gap in knowledge, the CONSENSUS Lifestyle Survey (CLS) was developed and implemented to explore expressed attitudes and reported behaviours towards the environment and consumption across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Opening with a critical review of previous perspectives adopted within attitude and behavioural research, this paper outlines the development of the CLS. Drawing on a survey of 1,500 respondents across three case study locations between 2010 and 2011, this paper adopts a framework of environmental behaviour to discuss the findings under the themes of ‘environmental concern variables’, ‘situational variables’ and ‘psychological variables’. Despite the expression of high levels of environmental concern and positive attitudes towards environmental protection and conservation, results reveal the persistence of value-action gaps. Results indicate the importance of structural variables for shaping consumption behaviours, such as availability of services and the built environment in particular sectors. Socio-demographic factors were found to be important influences on the adoption of water-saving actions. Inflexible social norms about communal sharing and ownership of goods were also highlighted.

This article, authored by a multidisciplinary group of scholars, probes the generative potential of infrastructure at this historical juncture. Accounting for the conceptual and material capacities of infrastructure, the article argues for the importance of paradox in understanding infrastructure. Thematically the article is organized around three key points that speak to the study of infrastructure: ruin, retrofit, and risk. The first paradox of infrastructure, ruin, suggests that even as infrastructure is generative, it degenerates. A second paradox is found in retrofit, an apparent ontological oxymoron that attempts to bridge temporality from the present to the future and yet ultimately reveals that infrastructural solidity, in material and symbolic terms, is more apparent than actual. Finally, a third paradox of infrastructure, risk, demonstrates that while a key purpose of infrastructure is to mitigate risk, it also involves new risks as it comes to fruition. The article concludes with a series of suggestions and provocations to view the study of infrastructure in more contingent and paradoxical forms. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","alternative life forms; development; environmental practices; futures; governance; markets/economies; politics; power; space/place/scale dynamics","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84962140659"

Since the late 19th century, the continual expansion of irrigation in this region has altered the natural hydrology of the Amu Darya delta, leading to widespread desertification and the near total disappearance of the world's fourth largest lake, the Aral Sea. The situation is widely acknowledged as an environmental catastrophe of unprecedented scale, and yet it is not the first irrigation crisis in Khorezmian history. Numerous events of irrigation collapse are recorded in the archaeological record of this oasis, with many in the scientific community now very interested in this past record for its potential to inform on the modern crisis. Unfortunately, there has also been a tendency to overlook the different historical conditions that led to irrigation in this oasis over the last three millennia. In this article, I take an alternative approach that draws on political ecology's insights about the cultural embeddedness of environmental behavior. I compare two periods of irrigation in Khorezm, one ancient and the other modern, to show how the particular social contexts of each period shaped irrigation schemes in different ways.

This evidence challenges the pervasive historical anchoring of the concept in the 1970s and illustrates the importance of the genealogical approach for the emerging literature on energy and sociotechnical imaginaries.

This paper develops a unique, temporally sensitive, qualitative approach of revisiting farms-which acts as a corrective to the current, speculative, understandings of how farmers' relationships with AESs change over time. The paper advances Bourdieusian-inspired ideas of the cultural construct of 'good farming' and 'knowledge cultures', bringing in the notion of hysteresis in order to develop a temporally-inflected consideration of farmers and their AES involvement. The findings reveal how, over the 10 year period, constructive interchanges have taken place between farmers and conservation officers, and stress the need, when thinking about the cultural sustainability of AESs, to recognise the multiple forms of capital that farms may produce. Conceptually, the paper reshapes the concept of the good farmer to: (1) recognise the geographically-contingent nature of the term; (2) redefine the concept away from the hitherto predominant focus on farming individuals; (3) give closer appreciation of the multiple forms of capital which constitute the good farmer identity (as well as how these intersect with each other); (4) and offer clearer recognition of how the good farmer ideals may evolve and be redefined over time. The paper moves on to make practical recommendations for those developing and administering AESs. Beyond the consideration of farmers, the paper has implications for wider understandings of environmental behaviours and associated identities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","","02648377","","","2-s2.0-84951759812"

It focuses on the ways in which professional community development facilitators and lead members of community groups attempt to actively shape how environmental projects are locally received. Drawing principally on identity, social sustainability and social practice theory scholarship, it reviews the often very personal and place-specific ways in which appeals to green identity are variously understood and applied, or are actively avoided, by community group leaders. Individuals who have become skilful in negotiating and influencing the presentation of environmental projects to the local community are understood here as (green) identity entrepreneurs. Arguably, it is the situated entrepreneurial skilfulness of lead individuals in negotiating the multiple and evolving (green) identities circulating through any one project, which plays a significant part in determining its subsequent impact and longevity. In understanding the contribution of (green) identity entrepreneurship, however, its relational association with everyday practices, routines and meanings of community and place is brought to the fore. The paper also considers how divergent external interpretations of what constitutes legitimate environmental practice at a local level further shape project identity. The discussion is informed by evidence drawn from a qualitative study of 17 community groups and 7 professional environmental support officers participating in a Welsh Government led programme aimed at facilitating ‘community action on climate change’. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Community; entrepreneur; environment; identity; sustainability","0308518X","","","2-s2.0-85021176058"

We therefore aimed at understanding how outdoor educators (OEs) refer to, and use, the natural environment while guiding field trips, and how their use of the natural environment affects student learning outcomes. Using a mixed-method design, we studied 20 field trips to natural environments with respect to the content the OEs communicated to their students, the skills they taught, and the methods they used. The data we collected included observations of the 20 field trips, interviews with the OEs and their students, and 569 students’ questionnaires. We found that the OEs often refer to scientific phenomena and concepts that can be seen outdoors, but they rarely attempt to develop values and attitudes. Eight types of learning outcomes were identified, of which structured active learning stood out as a practice that contributed to a variety of outcomes. Environmental action contributed to shaping students’ attitudes and environmental behavior intentions. The thorough analysis we offer of the use of the natural environment could guide OEs pedagogy and, particularly, their use of the natural environment and could lead to further research in this field. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","field trip; informal learning; learning outcomes; Natural environment; outdoor educator","21548455","","","2-s2.0-85045144227"

In order to research and 'map' them, we translated the theoretical 'Integrative Worldview Framework' (IWF) into an empirical, quantitative approach. We constructed a worldview-scale aiming to distinguish between four major worldviews - labeled traditional, modern, postmodern, and integrative - and explored their interface with opinions and behaviors with respect to climate change. The survey was conducted with representative samples of citizens in the Netherlands and the USA (n = 527 and n = 556). The hypothesized worldviews were found in the data with a reasonable degree of reliability, especially in the Dutch sample. We also found consistent relationships between these worldview-clusters and a range of opinions, political priorities, and behaviors.

The five visions are as follows: a vision of risk-free energy would eliminate catastrophic accidents and meltdowns. A vision of indigenous self-energization would see SMRs empowering remote communities and developing economies. A vision of water security would see SMR-powered desalination plants satisfying the world’s water needs. A vision of environmental nirvana would see SMRs providing waste-free and carbon-free electricity to preserve the earth’s biosphere. A vision of space exploration would see SMRs assisting in the colonization of the moon, Mars, and possibly other worlds. These visions help create a symbolic convergence among promoters, serving to attract political and financial support, and erasing previous nuclear failures from public discourse. Moreover, underlying these visions is a technological utopian ideal world where SMRs would generate plentiful energy of multiple kinds (electricity and heat), offering the necessary means for a life of comfort for all people by meeting various needs (lighting, temperature control, drinking water, and provision of scarce minerals) and without any environmental externalities or cause for concern about accidents. © The Author(s) 2014.","energy policy; environmental practices; governance; nuclear power; politics; power","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84904669661"

Since the late 19th century, the continual expansion of irrigation in this region has altered the natural hydrology of the Amu Darya delta, leading to widespread desertification and the near total disappearance of the world's fourth largest lake, the Aral Sea. The situation is widely acknowledged as an environmental catastrophe of unprecedented scale, and yet it is not the first irrigation crisis in Khorezmian history. Numerous events of irrigation collapse are recorded in the archaeological record of this oasis, with many in the scientific community now very interested in this past record for its potential to inform on the modern crisis. Unfortunately, there has also been a tendency to overlook the different historical conditions that led to irrigation in this oasis over the last three millennia. In this article, I take an alternative approach that draws on political ecology's insights about the cultural embeddedness of environmental behavior. I compare two periods of irrigation in Khorezm, one ancient and the other modern, to show how the particular social contexts of each period shaped irrigation schemes in different ways. Significantly different design and implementation features are apparent in the ancient versus modern systems, with vastly different implications for environmental sustainability and human well-being.","Aral Sea; Archaeology; Collapse; Irrigation; Nomadic pastoralism; Soviet Union; Water","10730451","","","2-s2.0-85011945187"

While policy support and landlords' sustainability aspirations can give impetus towards energy saving, most consumption and savings potential is in the hands of the tenant firms. Relevant research is often framed in terms of barriers and drivers of energy saving, where reasons for lack of saving are explored. This study takes an alternative approach. It offers two case studies of central London office buildings owned by different firms with large international building fleets, both of whom have a core business commitment to sustainability and are reporting significant energy savings in these buildings. Using qualitative interviews with the top-down agents who are charged with making savings happen, the study explores the reasons savings are being made despite the kinds of barriers found more generally. It finds sustainability agendas are being driven by highly motivated agents, skilled in the art of persuasion, with strong personal relationship skills, an indefatigable positive attitude, and the flexibility to change strategies where needed.

Based on a survey with a sample of 537 participants representing a broad range of demographic strata, this study identified seven dimensions of PEB as manifested in hotel settings (green consumerism, recycling, reuse, conservation, reduction, curtailing, and compromise) and examined the associations of psychological determinants with the seven PEB behavioral types. The results show that hotel customers display the least PEB when compromise of personal comfort is involved. The findings further suggest that the major determinant of PEB in hotel settings is nonenvironmental concerns, such as time and effort involved in PEB.

Drawing on the context of communicating seasonal climate predictions to farmers in Australia, we detail four key issues that scientists and science communicators would do well to reflect upon in order to become effective and ethical intermediaries. These issues relate to (1) the boundary work used to link science and values and thereby construct public identities, (2) emplacement, that is, the importance of situating knowledge in relation to the places with which people identify, (3) personal and organizational processes of reflexivity, and (4) the challenges of developing and maintaining the social and political capital necessary to simultaneously represent people’s identities and lifeworlds and the climate systems that affect them. Through a discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with Australian agro-climatologists, we suggest that three distinct “modes of extension” are apparent, namely, discursive, conceptual, and contextual. Our participants used these three modes interdependently to create knowledge that has salience, credibility, and legitimacy. They thereby generated new narratives of place, practice, and identity for Australian agriculture. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","engagement; environmental practices; expertise; governance; intervention; politics; power; space/place/scale dynamics","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84944062475"

While pro-environmental behaviour research has tended to focus on the actions of adults, almost one-third of UK households also include children and teenagers. Some research has suggested that young people are particularly adept at exerting influence on the ways in which the household as a whole consumes. Yet this influence is not only one-way; parents continue to have direct input into the ways in which their children relate to and interact with the objects of consumption (such as personal possessions) through routine processes including acquisition, use, keeping and ridding. In this paper I draw on qualitative research with British teenagers to highlight how young people and their parents interact when managing household material consumption. I use this discussion to suggest that promoters of sustainability might increase the efficacy of their efforts by engaging households as complex family units, where individual household members' distinct priorities are linked by shared familial values, and where family-based group identity is used to encourage shared commitment to lower-impact living. © 2015 The Authors.","Consumption; Divestment; Family; Identity; Sustainability; Young people","00167185","","","2-s2.0-84928583857"

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among developer organisations registered with Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia in Klang Valley. Response was obtained from project managers and the final sample collected was 87 cases, representing a response rate of 24.5 per cent. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to investigate the underlying structure of the NEP items while frequency distribution for the data set was used to gauge the environmental worldviews of the respondents. In addition, face-to-face interviews were carried out to gather more information to complements the findings of quantitative analyses. Findings: Five factors were extracted but due to heavy cross-loadings, two items from the original scale were dropped, reducing it to be a 13-item scale. The four factors retained explained 61.6 per cent of the variance and were duly named Human over nature, ecocrisis, rights of nature and limits of growth. High scores on both pro-NEP and pro-dominant social paradigm items revealed the co-existence of both ecological and utilitarian view of the environment among project managers. Similar outcome was obtained from interviews with project managers where they indicated efforts in finding compatibility between protecting the environment and exploiting natural resources for development. Research limitations/implications: The sample was restricted to housing developers in Klang Valley, thus the findings cannot be generalised to all developer organisations or other construction occupational groups. Practical implications: This research supported the multidimensionality claim of the environmental scale (NEP) where four distinctive dimensions were identified. The usage of individual subscales in understanding environmental beliefs may reveal interesting patterns in that each dimension could have positive and negative connotations on human behaviours. In addition, the co-existence of both an ecological and a utilitarian view of the environment revealed that these worldviews align well with sustainable development principles. Originality/value: This study is one of the few local studies that attempt to understand the environmental worldviews of project managers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental concern; Green building; Malaysian developer organization; New ecological paradigm; Pro-environmental behaviour; Sustainability","20466099","","","2-s2.0-84999861893"

Based on previous science and technology studies and science-policy literature, we define epistemic commitments as reflexive commitments to regimes of relevant research. Drawing on an in-depth enquiry in the case of biodiversity studies in France, we describe four regimes of research, each of them bringing together certain disciplinary approaches and technologies, certain scenarios about environmental changes (from species loss to an explosion of ecological engineering possibilities) and certain contributions to decision making and management. We distinguish between an environmentalist regime, a management-oriented regime, a function-based regime, and an ecoengineering regime. We give insights into how researchers’ commitments to these regimes are shaped, stabilized, and maintained over time, suggesting the coevolution of research practices, practical contributions, and environmental scenarios. We emphasize pluralism rather than hegemony of a type of knowledge over the others. Our results show that environmental research’s diversity does not result only from the complexity of reality itself but is also embedded in various views of scientific advancement, future scenarios, and useful contributions to environmental governance. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","academic disciplines and traditions; alternative life forms; environmental practices; futures; governance; other; politics; power","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84944055708"

Despite above-average levels of these motivators for cooperation, considerable experimental research points to no difference in cooperation between genders. What can explain women's lower-than-expected cooperation levels? Prior research indicates that, compared to men, women are less trusting and respond to fear incentives in social dilemmas - they are concerned about being exploited. We test these arguments in the context of environmental behaviors and argue that lower trust and greater responses to fear incentives mean that women's cooperation is predicated on trust. For men, trust does not predict environmental cooperation. The current research represents the first empirical test of these arguments.

There is now a need for a re-energised, concerted and joined-up approach that places environmental issues in a wider context – one that improves quality of life while building community resilience. This involves enhancing the capacity of neighbourhoods to recover, respond and adapt to environmental and socio-economic changes. This paper examines the experience gained in a participatory action research (PAR) study to build community resilience, where facilitators supported residents to take ownership of their own agendas. The New Earswick Good Life Initiative (GLI) was an 18-month project undertaken in a low-income suburb of York (UK). A range of approaches were used to identify activities which had the most potential to nurture resilience and foster a shift towards greater environmental sustainability. The GLI highlighted how the introduction of new ideas not only need to be locally relevant but also requires care and time in order for them to embed within community. Altering the way a community manages its environment involves transforming social relationships, strengthening institutions and influencing local power balances. Furthermore, it is necessary to build social capital, knowledge, leadership skills and support social networks to allow communities to effectively engage with relevant local and national policies. Only by providing opportunities to develop these resilient attributes can increased local responsibility be successful. The paper concludes by providing guidance on strengthening community resilience and delivering pro-environmental behaviour change. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","asset-based approach; behavioural change; community resilience; good life","13549839","","","2-s2.0-84946423365"

However, the existing literature on waste management rarely considers the cultural factors associated with predictors and enablers of recycling behaviours, nor has it deeply explored the relation between cultural access and such behaviours. Mindful of the relationship between cultural participation and learning, the main objective of this paper is to examine which Italian regions are ranked among the most ‘efficient’ in recycling, taking into account the variable of cultural participation. Using a Data Envelopment Analysis method applied to Italian regions for the period 2002–2007, we provide a measure of ‘efficiency’ that considers cultural consumptions (as input) and recycling (as output). Public data are drawn from two sources: the Italian Institute of Statistics database, ‘Cultura in cifre’, and the survey ‘Noi Italia – Environment section’. The results from the empirical analysis rank efficient and non-efficient regions in terms of connection between pro-environmental behaviour and cultural participation. The results also indicate a benchmark for ‘inefficient’ regions. The findings add to the discussion of cultural considerations for designing and implementing preventative pro-environmental strategies, that seek to reduce environmental costs and public environmental expenditure by factoring in – rather than out – the importance, role and impact of cultural access and participation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural consumptions; Data Envelopment Analysis; pro-environmental behaviour; recycling; technical efficiency","13504622","","","2-s2.0-84925438483"

Drawing on human and social capital theories and the resource-based view of the firm, we tested this proposition using data from a survey of 141 small manufacturing firms drawn from a survey of business enterprises in a metropolitan city in the southern region of the Philippines. The results of our analysis using structural equation modelling-partial least square approach show that both human capital such as age, experience and education of managers of the firm and social capital such as external managerial ties and networks have significant and positive contribution to the environmental management resources of firms although the effects vary in magnitude. The accumulation of environmental management resources not only is positively linked to the adoption by firms of pro-environment practices but also fully mediates the effects of the two types of capital on the adoption of such practices. Pro-environment practices are positively linked to better performance outcomes. The findings underscore the need to account for the intangible and more tacit forms of capital such as managerial talent, knowledge, skills and social ties and networks in the wider debate on how small manufacturing firms in developing countries can address the pressing need to integrate environmental sustainability in business. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Environmental management; Firm performance; Human social capital; Resource-based view; Sustainable business","22106723","","","2-s2.0-85076826892"

The data collection instruments include a survey questionnaire on farming in Almería, a province in Southeast Spain, and the methodology followed involves a two-step regression model. The main results show how several socio-economic and environmental-innovation features of family farms have positive effects on their economic performance. Among others, profitability increases when there are better educated and younger family farm decision-makers; the farm is specialized and supported by more efficient cooperatives: and, particularly, when the family farm displays greater concern for environmental practices and better disposition towards agroecological innovation. © 2016 by the authors.","Environmentally respectful practices; Family farm; Innovation; Profitability; Socio-economic dimension; Sustainability","20711050","","","2-s2.0-84991010644"

The paper further identifies some recommendations for the policy and design of recycling practices and facilities. Design/methodology/approach - In this qualitative study, two districts in Hong Kong from 2013 to 2014 were used as case studies. The research methods included field observations, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic research. The locations for field observation included lobbies, corridors, lifts, ground floors and streets. Direct interviews were conducted with residents, cleaners, government officials and expert planners and environmentalists. In-depth interviews and observations were conducted with six families following the interviews to identify important issues that might have been ignored in the semi-structured interviews and field observations. Findings - A holistic understanding of convenience in a scheduled society is effective in the design of high-quality recycling facilities. In terms of convenience, the gap between recycling and not recycling is rather obvious in Hong Kong. Therefore, it is necessary and important to adjust the difference in the degree of convenience regarding refuse disposal and recyclable collection. In addition, the enhancement of economic incentives could shift the degree of convenience and encourage public participation in recycling. The challenges of specific living conditions and social contexts should also be taken into account to enhance the convenience of recycling. Research limitations/implications - Further case studies are expected in other countries and cities with the purpose of gaining an in-depth understanding of the means by which to approach the convenience of recycling programmes within various social contexts. Comprehensive and continuous studies on these factors are recommended throughout the design and implementation processes to account for constantly changing situations. A clear understanding of convenience from the perspective of the users is important. Practical implicationsThe findings provide reference and direction for a holistic approach to the design and management of recycling facilities in Hong Kong. The findings also advocate the consideration of convenience from the perspective of the users. Social implicationsThe findings illustrate how to design and manage public facilities for waste recycling in ways that encourage household and community participation in terms of convenience. Originality/valueThe paper identifies the manner by which the culture of convenience and an institutionalised rhythm influence recycling practices. Although substantial studies on recycling indicate that convenience is a necessary characteristic of designs and services, the nature of convenience and the means by which to approach convenience in terms of public facilities are seldom discussed. The paper proposes several recommendations on the basis of the studies of the refuse collection programmes in other areas of Asia and case studies in Hong Kong.

The data were obtained from a questionnaire handed out to a sample of 250 students. With the information obtained, and after the scale validation process, a structural equation analysis has been conducted. Findings: Findings of the study highlight that environmental patterns and lifestyle factors are those that best characterize the ecological market segment. This group of young consumers is characterized by their self-identity and a feeling of uniqueness. They are people who always try to improve themselves and take actions which pose a new challenge for them. They are also characterized by having an ecological lifestyle, selecting and recycling products and taking part in events to protect the environment. This type of consumer is a present and future investment for firms that are committed to the environment.

Local people's responses to this dominance of “official” rational-technical sustainability concepts are central to recent cases of environmental controversy and lack of compliance to environmental policies that have characterised the study area but that show many parallels to conflicts and disputes elsewhere. Drawing on rich qualitative evidence from interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, this paper demonstrates how communities' responses to environmental policies depend on how well (or poorly) sustainability concepts underpinning these policies match local people's social-ecological practices and related place-specific views of what should be sustained. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Connemara; environmental policy; expertise; Ireland; lay knowledge; sustainability","13549839","","","2-s2.0-84958865935"

Our instrument allows for the specific measurement of self-reported behaviors, behavioral intentions, and inability to perform behaviors.

Despite the social nature of the challenge, perhaps the most fundamental social medium—social interaction—remains undertheorized in this area. To address this gap, this article applies Erving Goffman's understandings of social interaction to an ethnographic case study of a pro-environmental change initiative called Environment Champions. The analysis shows that social interaction plays a crucially important role in shaping responses to pro-environmental change processes, a role that has the potential to both help and hinder the spread of pro-environmental action.

These externalities result in a loss of welfare for citizens residing in neighbouring areas. In a context of sustainable development, companies must integrate concerns about the natural environment in their business strategy. External stakeholders, as residents, find it difficult to visualize the actions firms take to reduce their environmental impact, and the adoption of voluntary certified environmental management systems (EMSs) acts as a signal indicating the adequate environmental behaviour of these companies. These certifications enable companies to achieve the social legitimacy they need for long-term survival and competitiveness. In the context of a petrochemical industrial complex located in the port of Castellón (Spain), this paper primarily discusses whether such certifications - which act as signals of firms' desirable environmental conduct - translate into higher trust in firms and lower risk perception by residents. Contrary to what might be expected, despite the widespread use by companies of voluntary and certified EMSs, the research findings confirm a relatively high citizen perception of risk regarding the industrial complex and a low trust in companies. On the other hand, the findings also show a low trust in the public institutions responsible for authorizing and monitoring firms' activities and for enforcing possible sanctions in non-compliance cases. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Citizens' risk perception; Environmental management systems; Environmental policy; Petrochemical port complexes; Sustainable development; Trust","09644733","","","2-s2.0-84928271583"

Design/methodology/approach: This study involved a campus-wide online survey on undergraduate students at a large mid-western university. A direct measurement approach to the theory of planned behavior was used to measure changes in attitudes, normative beliefs, perceived behavioral controls and self-reported behaviors on five different environmental sustainability behaviors. Findings: Overall findings support the notion that higher education institutions can be effective communication channels for sustainability issues, as students who have been in college for a longer period of time reported somewhat more positive attitudes, normative and efficacy beliefs and more sustainable behaviors. Practical implications: By measuring specific components of the theory of planned behavior, this study provides insights on specific areas in which campaigns targeting college students in different college years could become more effective.

Yet the influence of religion on managers’ environmental decisions has until now remained unexamined despite its known importance. In this article, we examine the empirical association between religion—primarily Christianity—and the environmental practices a firm’s management undertakes by investigating their OLS, principal component, simultaneous, and endogenous effects. Employing a large and extensive U.S. sample, we find a negative association between the environmental practices initiated by a firm’s managers and the religiosity of the surrounding community, after controlling for various firm and demographic characteristics. In addition, after mitigating endogeneity with the dynamic system generalized method of moment, we still find an inverse association between religiosity and environmental-friendly decisions of management. We interpret these results as providing some support for the “dominion hypothesis” that claims Christian beliefs discourage environmental concern, but not for the “stewardship hypothesis” that implies that Christianity encourages people to “exercise a responsible stewardship over nature.” Nevertheless, additional analysis shows Christian groups differ significantly in how each influences managers’ environmental decisions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Christianity; Dominion; Environment; Lynn White; Religiosity; Stewardship","01674544","","","2-s2.0-84948577442"

There has been, however, very little research done on linking individual behavioural change theories with these conservation initiatives and moving beyond behavioural change to consider the role of learning, values and personal agency. There has also been little concern for the role of nonhuman agency in programme participation. This study aims to investigate the enabling conditions under which private biodiversity conservation is most likely to take place in agricultural landscapes by investigating the case of the WWF Biodiversity and Wine Initiative (BWI), an exemplar of 'successful' voluntary market-based conservation of the globally important Fynbos biome in the Cape Winelands of South Africa. Using a conceptual framework for pro-environmental behaviour, titled AMPR, this study argues that transitioning to more sustainable production in an agricultural context is constructed upon an in-depth understanding of the value system that underpins the motivational structure of the participant. Data were collected to assess participant's environmental awareness; motivation for programme participation; and the pathways for enabling implementation and the rewards for joining the BWI. The inter- and intra-connectedness between these four components (awareness, motivation, pathway and reward), and a list of success factors of and barriers to implementation are investigated. This study proposes two models using the AMPR framework that illustrate the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations of participants and how this impacts on programme participation, where nonhuman agency forms an explicit part of extrinsic motivation. Based on the two AMPR models, promising policy suggestions that could aid BWI in future are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agency; Behaviour; Conservation; Intervention; South Africa; Voluntary market-based mechanism","02648377","","","2-s2.0-84936887401"

This paper examines how modern insights about bounded rationality, social interaction and learning can contribute to making transition polices more effective in addressing barriers and opportunities to realize a sustainability transition in the near future. We argue that the behavioral underpinnings of features like lock-in, surprises in innovation systems and network interactions have been insufficiently elaborated and connected to policy design. We identify and illustrate the most important behavioral features of relevant stakeholders in transition processes. By focusing on behavioral features at both individual and organizational levels, we arrive at recommendations for policy makers regarding important barriers to change and how to overcome these. Specific policy insights are offered at multiple levels, for different stakeholders, and associated with both behavioral biases and social interactions. The analysis combines insights from the literatures on sustainability transitions, ""environmental-behavioral economics"", and behavioral foundations of learning and innovation. Our framework may serve as a basis for coherent behavior studies of transitions that otherwise run the risk of being ad hoc. This will improve conditional forecasting of system responses to transition policies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agency; Behavioral studies; Bounded rationality; Innovation; Learning; Multi-level framework; Social interaction; Sustainability transition","00163287","","","2-s2.0-84927559124"

The information that such estimators supply affords considerable heuristic potential for population-ecological research both because they implicate the environmental, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms that condition population growth, and because they impose much-needed empirical constraints on our efforts to build theory addressing long-run human population dynamics. However, the earnestness with which these estimators have been applied warrants caution. First, several nonidentical measures of population growth are current in both formal demography and dTFA, creating an opportunity for their equivocation. Second, our ability to insightfully interrogate growth estimates for population-ecological information has been checked by a tendency to interpret them in the framework of off-the-shelf parametric growth models ill-suited to long-run population dynamics. This paper evaluates the biodemographic merit of three estimators recently applied in dTFA. It also advocates a transition away from parametric and toward dynamic growth models and introduces an inductive, regression-based approach to the latter. A Monte Carlo simulation study indicates that this inductive approach can successfully recapture information about environmental influences on population growth from archaeological summed probability distributions, less so from kernel density estimates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeological demography; Composite kernel density estimation; Demographic temporal frequency analysis; Dynamic population modeling; Population growth measurement; Taphonomic bias","03054403","","","2-s2.0-85014830541"

To this extent, the paper advances two arguments. First, parties more central to the CLRTAP network can rely on and signal mutual interests, shared preferences, and decreased uncertainty with all actors involved. In turn, a central position embodies social capital, which facilitates that a well-connected state is ceteris paribus more likely to cooperate with the regime. Second, if other countries in the network do not cooperate, however, it is likely that the positive effect stemming from social capital disappears and that a state will defect even if it has a central position in the network. The authors’ empirical analysis provides support for the theory and may have important implications for studies on regime effectiveness and on networks in general. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CLTRAP; Information flows; Network centrality; Regime effectiveness; Social capital; Social network analysis","15679764","","","2-s2.0-84877265085"

In response to this, there has been a plethora of studies into how behaviour change can be enabled, predominantly from psychological and sociological perspectives. This has resulted in a substantial body of knowledge into the factors that drive behaviour change and how they can be manipulated to achieve desired social goals. In this paper, we describe a study that draws on this body of knowledge to design an intervention to drive behaviour change across the hairdressing sector, and by the process of diffusion, across the vast social networks of this occupational group to influence domestic hair-care practices. The intervention was successful: hairdressers indicated positive intentions to adopt more sustainable practices within their salons and pass them onto their customers. The customer survey (N = 776) confirms this: customers surveyed after their hairdresser attended the Green-Salon-Makeover intervention were significantly more likely to report that environmental issues had been considered in their salon visit and that they themselves would consider such issues in their hair-care practices at home than customers who were surveyed before the intervention. © 2014, The Author(s).","Behaviour change; Diffusion; Hairdressers; Practice theory; Pro-environmental behaviour; Social networks; Social norms; Sustainable lifestyle","01674544","","","2-s2.0-84957436998"

Definitive conclusions are difficult given the complexity of biocultural systems; nevertheless, extant research has identified many themes and dynamics that hinder environmental understanding and mobilization by religious individuals, whether Abrahamic or involved in religions that originated in Asia.

The knowledge about the environment that was investigated in this research includes environmental knowledge and environmental action knowledge. The internal factors include elements of attitude, personal responsibility, and beliefs, while the elements of environment factors are social influences, information resources, and environmental management facilities. In addition, this study used an environmental knowledge test and questionnaire as research instruments. A total of 445 aboriginal students from the Malaysian state of Pahang were involved in this research. The research data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The research findings showed that the predictor factors (knowledge, attitude, personal responsibility, beliefs, social influences, information resources, and environmental management facilities) contributed 44% towards environmental care behaviour. In fact, the factors that contributed most to environmental behaviour were social influences and beliefs, followed by environmental management facilities, attitude, and personal responsibility. Nonetheless, knowledge concerning the environment did not contribute towards behaviour, but it influenced attitude, which in turn affected behaviour. Hence, the factors that have been identified to contribute to environmental care behaviour should be considered in planning educational development for the aboriginal community in order to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2016 Rahman.","Environmental behavior and aboriginal environmental knowledge; Environmental education","13063065","","","2-s2.0-84982221066"

Determinants of individuals’ involvement in pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) are evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory model was created to investigate the relationship between PEBs and potential predictors that were selected based on the purposes of environmental risk communication and environmental education improvements. Those factors included dispositional, attitudinal, motivational, environmental knowledge, and psychosocial characteristics. Questionnaire surveys with well-educated people (n=810), that is those holding an educational qualification that ranged from a senior high school degree to a doctoral degree, were conducted. Multiple regression analysis was performed to justify the proposed relationship. Findings: The result revealed that PEBs of well-educated people could be greatly predicted by an individual’s sense of obligation, perceived probability of receiving impacts from environmental problems, outcome expectancy from environmental behaviors, and environmental knowledge related to environmental phenomena and appropriate environmental actions; whereas, an individual’s environmental worldview and life satisfaction were less significant. Moreover, most of psychosocial variables were not significant predictors. Originality/value: Factors determining well-educated people’s engagement in PEBs were evaluated.

Drawing on the results of a survey which explores the attitudes of women who work in mining towards the environment, I conclude that the sex of employees is not the best indicator of possible change in environmental management and practices in the industry. Women who work in mining do not display a particularly strong or unique connection to the environment which would encourage them to drive change in their workplaces.

The implementation of social responsibility programs is justified by the benefits that result from a good relationship of the firm with key stakeholders. The present research investigates the links among firms' relationship with stakeholders, firms' champion behavior, stakeholders' satisfaction and firms' competitive success in regional contexts where social responsibility is promoted. Using the resource-based theory and the concept of shared value, a conceptual model is proposed in which a strong firm relationship with stakeholders will cause the stakeholder' satisfaction and will help the firm to become a champion in the market, contributing to improved competitiveness. This empirical analysis was based on survey data through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) from 130 Spanish firms in the Region of Extremadura. Participants were firm managers in regional clusters involved in the social responsibility journey promoted by the local government.

The environmental justice literature, however, suggests certain populations are understandably more skeptical about who they can trust with respect to environmental threats in their communities, thus undermining the hypothesis that greater trust results in positive environmental outcomes. We seek to test the relative direct and indirect influences of generalized trust and knowledge of environmental issues on individuals' willingness to make sacrifices for the environment. Methods: Based on established theory in the social capital, environmental concern, and environmental justice literature, this study conducts structural equation modeling using data from the 2010 General Social Survey. Results: This analysis finds support for both social capital and environmental justice arguments. However, the positive direct effect of generalized trust on a willingness to sacrifice outweighs its indirect negative effect via perceived environmental threats by a factor of four to one, suggesting generalized trust is a net catalyst for environmental action. Knowledge of issues is positively associated with both perceived environmental risks and a willingness to sacrifice. Conclusion: Generalized trust is an important motivator for self-sacrifice in the realm of environmental behavior. We should nonetheless be skeptical of efforts to promote it that ignore the unequal distribution of environmental threats in the population. © 2015 Southwestern Social Science Association.","","00384941","","","2-s2.0-84958838587"

In this study, a cross-level integrated theory of corporate environmental behavior uses Gunningham et al’s. (2003) license framework and Paternoster and Simpson’s (1993; 1996) rational choice theory of corporate crime to portray how individuals within corporations decide to offend or to overcomply with environmental regulations while accounting for the organizational context. Specifically, external pressures (legal, social, and economic) on the corporation, plus internal corporate policies and culture, affect individual-level cost-benefit analyses. In turn, these cost-benefit calculations impact the behavioral decisions made by corporate managers. Four sets of hypotheses based on this integration are tested using an environmental vignette survey of individuals. The results provide mixed support for the integrated theory. It is also noted that predictors of environmental offending are different from those predicting overcompliance.

The reason for engaging in this topic is resource scarcity concerns, as urks contain large amounts of copper and aluminum that could be “mined” for the benefit of the environment. Our starting point is that there is a certain nonstagnant capacity of waste-like entities such as urks and that their resistance to categorization is crucial to encapsulate their political potential (cf. Hawkins 2006; Moore 2012; Hird 2013). We investigate how this indeterminate capacity has implications in terms of where future trajectories for urk recovery are conceivable. The study is based on interviews with respondents from the infrastructure and waste sectors in Sweden. By stressing the relationship between urks and their geosocial subsurface surroundings, we use the respondents’ exploratory interpretations of urks to outline a spectrum of issues that should be further discussed for urks to become a matter of concern. The negotiation of these issues, we suggest, can be conceived of as a form of navigation along the perceived fault lines between actors and priorities, and they must be resolved for increased urk recovery to occur. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","environmental practices; governance; infrastructure; politics; power; urban mining","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84981736612"

Past research has found that this trend – demonstrated by a re-centralising housing market – was already underway, pre-crash, in Louisville, Kentucky over the “boom” period from 2000 to 2006. Drawing on original 2006 survey data for Louisville, this study regresses two components of environmentalism (behaviour and concern) on socio-demographics and residence. Findings show urbanites in Louisville are indeed significantly more environmentally friendly in their behaviour but not in their concern. Countering some claims, residents of single-family homes also exhibit significantly higher levels of environmental behaviour and concern than those residing in apartments and condominiums. Finally, in a surprise finding, recent movers from the suburbs to the city do not differ in their behaviour and are significantly less concerned about the environment than urbanites, suburbanites, and all metropolitan residents. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","environmental attitudes; new ecological paradigm; pro-environmental behaviour; suburban; urban","13549839","","","2-s2.0-84938551992"

This community was broadly defined as any Canadian engineers, technicians, biologists, planners, economists, scholars conducting physical and social research, public servants (e.g., national, provincial, municipal), and civil society activists who were self-identified as working on water-related issues. Participants' essay responses were assessed by using an integrated comparative framework - drawing insights from economics, social network theory, environmental psychology, innovation, knowledge management, and pro-environmental behavior. Focus was placed on participants' responses about what motivated their careers, how this motivation sustained their professional participation over time, and whether different experiences with people and/or nature influenced their contributions to Canadian WRP. The data analysis indicated that female professionals draw on their relationships and experiential knowledge to make career decisions, sustain their career progression, and direct their career contributions. The analysis suggested that both recruitment and retention within the water community could be improved by providing recognition of alternative knowledge opportunities, including opportunities to develop skill mastery over existing or new skills, and experiential knowledge in nature for children, and by facilitating mentorship relationships and social networks. By doing so, these interventions would help sustain the availability of diverse knowledge resources held by female professionals within Canadian WRP. © National Association of Environmental Professionals 2014.","","14660466","","","2-s2.0-84897548629"

This study examined levels of awareness of e-waste disposal among university students in Ghana, and their proenvironmental decision-making using two outcome variables: knowledge on environmental impact and policy issues (EIPI) and environmental behavior and sustainability (EBS). Reliability estimates (Cronbach's alpha) for the two outcomes variables were 0.91 and 0.72, respectively. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to explore and determine the underlying factor structure for the latent constructs employed as dependent variables; and to verify the factor structure while testing the relationships between observed indicators and their underlying latent constructs. Ordinary Least Square techniques were then used to examine the effects of theoretically relevant covariates on the selected dependent variables. Results indicate satisfactory model adequacy, (χ2=33.59, df = 29; p < 0.255; RMSEA = 0.01). Awareness of e-waste among the students was generally low. Students' awareness of e-waste contamination of air and soil (effects) was higher than their awareness of acceptable e-waste practices (change strategies) or environmental policy (vision). Gender and level of study were both positively related to environmental behavior and sustainability (EBS). Compared to females, males scored higher (b = 0.192) on EBS.

In spite of much concerns of both local and international bodies in the quest to preserve species in the environment, their efforts have not been fully successful in achieving such goals. Yet, measures to control species extinctions prove to no avail. In the view of this, alternative indigenous methods of species conservation in the environment must be advocated. The descriptive design was adopted, while theoretical triangulation of functionalism, symbolic interactionism and biocentrism were used as theoretical frameworks of analysis. 382 respondents participated in the study using the instruments of questionnaire as well as 5 key informants' interviewees (KII). Stratified random sample was employed for the selection of respondents as well as purposive sampling for the selection of key informants interviewees (KII) across the five communities (namely, Ogolomabiri, Basanbiri, Odeama, Okpoama and Brass) that constitutes the people of Nembe. Simple percentages and pie chart descriptive statistical tools were used for the analysis of the data collected for the study. Findings showed that totemism as an indigenous practice promotes species conservation which include python, eagle, shark, zimbaerema and snails with minimal threats or risks to the social environment. In the view of the findings of the study, policy instruments were provided in order to facilitate the design of environmental policies such as the establishment of zoos and game reserves, public enlightenment campaigns to encourage indigenous environmental practices across board as well as embarking on research in other indigenous practices that will promote environmental preservation and species conservatism.","Ecosystem; Environmental movement; Environmental preservation; Species' extinction; Totemism","20399340","","","2-s2.0-84900428986"

There is some initial evidence to suggest that this is particularly likely for people with a strong environmental self-identity. However, not much is known about how environmental self-identity influences pro-environmental actions. In this research, we aimed to test whether, and if so, via which process environmental self-identity is related to environmentally-friendly behaviour. We conducted three studies to test our hypotheses. In the first study, our hypotheses were confirmed in a sample of the general population using a correlational design. In the second study, we replicated our findings with a different indicator of moral obligation and with a different dependent variable. In the third study, we tested our model in an experimental design. Again, we found support for our hypotheses that environmental self-identity is related to one's obligation-based intrinsic motivation (that is, feelings of moral obligation) to act pro-environmentally, which in turn affects pro-environmental actions. As expected, the obligation-based intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between environmental self-identity and environmentally-friendly behaviour. Our findings suggest that strengthening environmental self-identity may be a cost-effective way to promote pro-environmental actions, as people with a strong environmental self-identity are likely to act in an environmentally-friendly manner without an external incentive to do so. © 2013 .","Environmental self-identity; Intrinsic motivation; Obligation-based intrinsic motivation; Personal norm; Pro-environmental behaviour","09593780","","GECHE","2-s2.0-84886720853"

The implication of perpetuating this separation in law curricula is that generations of legal practitioners will remain unlikely to develop a coherent system of environmental law that aligns rights with responsibilities. Environmental education scholar David Orr argues that 'all education is environmental education'. But legal education often excludes environmental considerations even where these are materially relevant.

However, few studies have succeeded in fully explaining people's behavior based on these factors alone. To further the understanding of people's everyday energy use, a goal-oriented approach based on activity theory has been applied to discuss energy conservation from a multiple goal perspective based on the findings from an interview study with 42 informants. The findings show that the informants used energy to fulfill goals linked to basic needs or desires related to their well-being. Even though the majority of informants had an explicit goal to reduce their energy consumption, many experienced conflicts with other competing goals, which often made energy conservation undesirable or challenging. The findings suggest that actions to reduce energy use will most often not be prioritized if they cannot be integrated into people's daily life without jeopardizing their possibilities to achieve their primary goals and satisfy their everyday needs. It is thus vital to consider people's everyday life and the many conflicts they experience when aiming to understand why people do, or do not, prioritize energy conservation during everyday activities. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Behavior change; Conservation; Energy; Goals; Pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-84934873146"

In this paper, we argue that in order to develop robust sustainability learning feedbacks between knowledge and action we need the coupling of Human Information and Knowledge Systems (HIKS) with social-ecological systems (SES) dynamics. In particular, a substantial change in core worldviews and understandings about the nature of HIKS and how they relate to SES is required. Changing such epistemological and ontological assumptions of the quality of robust social-ecological knowledge is a first step for the emergence of transformative pathways towards sustainability in research, education, and policy. To enhance our understanding of such complexity, we describe two general ideal-type worldviews of HIKS and their relationships with SES in Western culture. One worldview understands information and knowledge systems as evolving in a closed, ahistorical, social-ecologically disembodied linear space, in ways which can be reduced to a single form of representation. The other worldview understands information and knowledge systems as operating in an open space composed of multiple and diverse patterns of hybrid social-ecological practices and configurations, inevitably embedded in specific times, spaces and contextual conditions. We argue that the open, but socio-ecologically embodied worldview is better suited to support sustainability learning and transformation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity; Human Information and Knowledge Systems (HIKS); Ideal types; Social-ecological systems (SES); Sustainability learning; Worldviews","18736416","","ESCPF","2-s2.0-84876453550"

One set of studies divides environmental values into three types: (1) self-interest (or egoistic) values; (2) humanistic altruism, and (3) biospheric altruism. Another study analyzes three types of self-construal as pro-environment indicators: (1) independent, (2) interdependent, and (3) metapersonal. Analyzing these models in light of the tripartite social psychological model of (1) religion as means; (2) religion as an end unto itself; and (3) religion as quest, I demonstrate that both the biospheric and metapersonal orientations, and perceptions that tend toward the pantheistic end of the sacrality scale, are the strongest predictors of pro-environment behavior. Put simply, nature veneration is predictive of pro-environmental behavior. I further argue that available data make the testing of this hypothesis worth pursuing whether naturevenerating religions are growing in the United States and beyond. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2013.","Biospheric; Egoistic; Humanistic; Metapersonal; Nature veneration; Pantheism; Proenvironment","17494915","","","2-s2.0-84884389094"

At the core of these debates are differing perceptions of the level and types of risks involved with the extraction activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, truck traffic, air emissions, and population growth. Risks described include the potential for human and environmental health implications, as well as community change and economic gain. This article explores the nature of perceived risks associated with Marcellus Shale development by using data from a household survey (N = 1,917) conducted in 2009-10 in Pennsylvania and New York counties located in the core areas of the Marcellus Shale region. The article describes a quantitative measure of risk perceptions. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that trust in institutions responsible for managing the risks associated with development and attitudes related to relationships between people and nature are associated strongly with perceptions of risk. Other associated variables include reported knowledge of environmental, social, and economic impacts, mineral rights ownership, demographic characteristics (gender, income), and state of residence. Implications of these findings are discussed, particularly as related to improving local discourse surrounding Marcellus Shale development.

This article contributes to the wider debate on the disconnect between environmental concern and behaviour between 1971 and 2008 by using the choice and combination of policy instruments as an indicator of evolving relationship between the governing and the governed.

A lack of suitable theoretical frameworks limits research on farmers' environmental behaviours, and there has been little integration of social sciences in the agricultural adoption literature. This paper details a predictive model of pro-environmental agricultural practices, drawing on psychological frameworks: Value-Belief-Norms and Theory of Planned Behaviour. Dry-land farmers in Central New South Wales, Australia (n=422), were surveyed about behaviours deemed to have positive impacts on the environment by local natural resource management authorities. A rigorous measure of complex land management practice is developed in relation to native vegetation, weeds, soil, stock, and perennials. The model was able to predict 52% of the variance in complex behaviour. Contextual factors, values, attitudes, and norms are identified as important predictors. Results suggest skills and abilities, environmental constraints, biospheric values, and a sense of being able to control one's destiny are significant precursors to pro-environmental practices. The NRM policy context and policy implications are discussed. Holistic strategies and social learning processes are identified as beneficial for farmer well-being and environmental outcomes. © 2014.","Agriculture; Environmental values; Land management; Locus of control; Pro-environmental behaviour; Structural equation modelling; Theory of Planned Behaviour; Values Beliefs Norms","07430167","","JRSTF","2-s2.0-84893421124"

We use hierarchical OLS to analyze the survey data to find that an orientation to, commitments to, and dynamic flexibility in, the firm’s CSR and green policies are significant factors in a firm’s CSR- and green-based competitive advantages. So, while some tradeoffs are likely between activities aimed at financial performance and those also aimed at improving social/environmental performance, opportunities do exist for small- and medium-sized enterprises to do both well and good.

This essay presents the first systematic study of public opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a 2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these results to identify geographical variation in public perception and political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances. Eco-mobilization-collective political action about the environment-represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial societies. The study finds that these political actions about the environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Central Asia; environmental behavior; former Soviet Union; gold mining; Kyrgyzstan; protest; public opinion; water resources","1060586X","","","2-s2.0-84882431874"

Education for sustainability categories of environmental, socio-cultural, political and economic factors were used to identify factors that interact to influence affective and cognitive domains, which affect environmentalist behavior. These influences in reality operated symbiotically but for purposes of analysis they have been portrayed sequentially. The portrayal of the autoethnographer's vocabulary of motives and identity theory applied to group commitment were used as analytic tools. The research methodology employed provides a strategy for investigating biography, which gives access to lived experience as a basis for understanding factors influencing environmentalism. Processes of metacognition and reflexivity, supported by critical engagement with co-researchers, provide access to deep analysis of the biography.

While this is increasingly recognized in a burgeoning interdisciplinary body of literature, there remains an ongoing need to clarify and conceptualize the relationship between planning and health. This is especially the case from the perspective of built environment professionals, as they increasingly focus on health and well-being issues. The key contribution of this article is such a conceptualization-a framework to group and review the literature in this rapidly expanding area of research. We suggest three domains where urban planning can most effectively focus support for health and well-being. These domains address the principle risk factors for contemporary chronic disease-physical inactivity, obesity, and social isolation. Our framework is then used to review an evidence base that supports the development, prioritization, and implementation of healthy built environment practice. This article concludes with a critical discussion of theoretical and practical tensions identified as potential impediments to the progression of this new and exciting interdisciplinary area of research. © The Author(s) 2014.","health; methods; planning practice; quality of life; recreation and open space","08854122","","","2-s2.0-84899819677"

A great deal of finances and attention are currently being directed to gender in development and environmental organizations. At the same time, as gender research has become more sophisticated and theoretically strong, there is also frustration among academic researchers as well as practitioners and policy makers that it appears to have had a marginal effect on environmental practice on the ground.Policies have turned to gender mainstreaming, attempted to include women and other marginalized social groups in environmental management and markets. Change has been mixed. Mainstreaming can become a technocratic exercise. The assumption that competing interests can be negotiated by adding women to organizations for environmental governance, in disregard for social relations, is problematic. Stereo-types about women and men, sometimes buttressed by gender research predominate in policy and programs. Inclusion in markets offer new options but can further curb women's agency. Contradictions arise - as gender becomes a part of the official machinery, when women are regarded as a collective but addressed as individuals in programs and when the focus is on the governance of gender with little attention on the gender of neoliberal governance. Yet, support for 'gender programs' has also led to unintended openings for empowerment. It is clear that the meaning of gender is far from settled and there are intensified efforts to define what 'gender' is in each context. I discuss the renewed interest in gender and what this engagement with power might mean for gender research, policy and practice and where we might go from here. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","","02775395","","","2-s2.0-84919452514"

This could be especially true for behaviors that are perceived as markers of political attitudes. In an examination of self-reported recycling and conservation behavior, we find that controlling for a range of alternative explanations for why individuals engage in pro-environmental behavior, partisan and ideological dispositions are among the most robust causes of such behavior.

The article compares the views of a sample of 2,436 students in 21 economies. The results reveal that the student cohort that took subjects on ethics, sustainability, and social responsibility were no more likely to express stronger environmental attitudes or change their environmental behaviors than the cohort that had not taken subjects of this nature. Surprisingly, counterintuitive results were revealed, whereby students who had taken subjects that incorporated aspects of personal social responsibility exhibited no greater tendency to accept personal responsibility. Instead, both groups were equally likely to transfer blame to an ethereal “other.” The study concludes by suggesting that a major rethink of sustainability and social consciousness raising subjects is required. © 2012 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education.","climate change; curriculum; curriculum design; ethics; personal responsibility","10963480","","","2-s2.0-84907910707"

This paper suggests that food redistribution organisations hold both pro-social and pro-environmental aims, due to their concern with reducing food surplus and food insecurity. To achieve this, they must motivate food businesses to donate their surplus food. However, little is known about the values, attitudes, and motives of food industry donors. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical and conceptual overview to set out principles from which empirical data on food redistribution will be analysed or critiqued. Specifically, it explores pro-social and pro-environmental literature, as these fields have examined the motivations behind donations and reducing environmental impact. This review highlights that charitable giving of food is different to other inorganic material, such as money. Thus, future research is needed to capture the unique temporal, emotional, social, and environmental factors that motivate food donations. This information may contribute to the development of strategies that target and motivate people from the food industry to become food donors. Alternatively, it may reveal concerns about food donations, and highlight the need for other approaches to food waste and food insecurity. © 2015 by the authors.","Charitable giving; Commercial food waste; Food redistribution; Motivations; Philanthropy; Pro-environmental behaviour; Pro-social behaviour","20711050","","","2-s2.0-84934301094"

Using the rebuilding of two heavily damaged poor and minority neighborhoods in post-Katrina New Orleans as case studies, this article makes evident the different conceptualizations of justice embedded within the strategies and techniques of NGOs and community organizations. Examining both practices and outcomes, I argue that the definition of justice that NGOs implicitly or explicitly adopt in their strategies and technologies of assistance can lead to very different results in postdisaster neighborhood revitalization. For science and technology studies, conceptions of justice can help articulate a more critical social science that opens up the descriptive/normative divide.

Monitoring the electricity use of 72 households has facilitated analysis of its association with their environmental attitudes and contact with environmental organisations. Although standard statistical approaches fail to uncover a relationship between contact with environmental organisations and attitudes and behaviour, a deductive blockmodelling approach tells a different story. Low household electricity use is associated with households sharing pro-environmental attitudes and contact with environmental organisations. High energy use is associated with households not sharing any of these; and moderate energy use is associated with a moderate degree of sharing.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey of environmental managers was conducted to examine the role of organizational support and individual environmental commitment on key informant perceptions of environmental organizational practices including participation in extra-organizational voluntary environmental programs, adoption of a company-specific environmental management system (EMS), and involvement in ISO 14000 certification. Findings: Study findings demonstrate that high perceptions of organizational support for the environment affect the likelihood of an organization's implementation of environmental practices. Similarly, study findings indicate that higher levels of environmental commitment of the individual responsible for environmental management practices affects the likelihood of an organization's implementation of environmental practices. Lastly, the statistical results provide evidence that high organizational support and high personal commitment by an environmental champion interact to enhance the implementation of environmental practices. Originality/value: This study represents the first development and empirical testing of a model of how organizational support for environmental practices and environmental managers' commitment to such endeavors affect the adoption of environmental practices by organizations. Additionally, the research illustrates how theoretical perspectives from the organizational behavior literature can be fruitfully adopted to explain behavior in the field of supply chain management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental championship; Environmental commitment; Environmental management; Environmental management practices; Managers; Perceptions of environmental organizational support","09600035","","","2-s2.0-84878826093"

To address this problem, it is fundamental to understand pro-environmental behaviors in the population, as well as the factors that determine them. There are, however, very few studies conducted in Latin America that are focused in understanding the environmental behavior of its citizens. The main goal of this research was to study the environmental behaviors of a Chilean community and identify the factors that determine them. To that end, a diverse set of environmental behaviors (power and water conservation, environmentally-aware consumer behavior, biodiversity protection, rational automobile use and ecological waste management) and sociodemographic and attitudinal factors-based on the VBN model-were evaluated. Survey data was obtained from a statistically representative sample (N = 1537) in Santiago, Chile. Our results suggest that several participants displayed tendencies that favor more responsible environmental behaviors, with high environmental concern, and demonstrating their ample awareness of the consequences of failing to protect the environment. Nevertheless, the highest average scores of environmental behavior were related to low cost behaviors and those that imposed the fewest behavioral restrictions. In global terms, we concluded that the youngest subjects in the lowest socioeconomic group obtained the lowest scores across the pro-environmental behavior spectrum. © 2015 by the authors.","Environmental behavior; Environmental management; Pro-environmental behavior","20711050","","","2-s2.0-84949294286"

In this article, we empirically explore the dimensionality of four environmental scales of different specificity, their interrelatedness, and their partial contribution to the explanation of recycling behavior. To facilitate the comparison of different studies, we integrate the scales into a hierarchical model. Methods: In a German mail survey (n = 1,330), we queried participation in household waste recycling, Inglehart's postmaterialism scale, the new environmental paradigm scale, and a general and specific attitude scale. Using traditional path analysis and latent structural equation modeling, we test the hierarchical structure of environmental values, beliefs, and attitudes and their contribution to explaining recycling behavior. Results: We find direct effects of specific attitudes on behavior, but no direct effects of higher-level cognitions. Rather, values and primitive beliefs influence general attitudes, which in turn determine specific attitudes. The empirical analyses confirm the proposed hierarchical structure. Conclusions: Our research reaffirms Ajzen and Fishbein's postulate of correspondence. Comparison of different studies is only meaningful when the hierarchical position of the respective scales is taken into account properly. To facilitate cumulative research, we propose to use standardized general scales such as the NEP in addition to more specific operationalizations. © 2013 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","Attitude structure; Environmental attitudes; Environmental concern; New environmental paradigm (NEP); Recycling; Values","15406237","","","2-s2.0-84881249176"

In particular, planners propose supplementing drinking water with reclaimed water as a sustainable solution to the growing challenge of urban water scarcity. Public opposition is currently considered the primary barrier to implementing successful potable water reuse projects; nonetheless, public responses to reclaimed water are not well understood. Based on a survey of over 250 residents of Tucson, Arizona, this article assesses the relationship between trust in the professional institutions responsible for municipal water development and willingness to drink reclaimed water. Results demonstrate that public acceptance of potable reuse is contingent on trust in the authorities who influence design of sociotechnical systems for water supply and reuse-including water and wastewater utilities, regulators, consultants, academics, and elected local officials. Findings emphasize the highly interdependent social and political factors that inform personal decisions to support or reject potable reuse. The authors suggest that achieving greater acceptance of potable reuse will require bringing local and regional water policy in line with public values, as well as finding ways to incorporate these values into the planning process. © The Author(s) 2012.","environmental practices; expertise; governance; politics; power","01622439","","","2-s2.0-84876730471"

We use cluster analysis to create an ordinal typology of four types of consumers, conduct an analysis of variance to characterize the resultant clusters, and perform logistic regression to predict the net effect of urban and neighbourhood context on sustainable consumption practices. We find that neighbourhood and environmental attitude are the strongest predictors of sustainable consumption practices. We conclude by arguing many sustainable activities are more difficult to incorporate into daily routine when residing in the suburban neighbourhood. While suburban residents may feel strongly that they should consume less, their geographic location appears to significantly constrain their ability to meaningfully reduce their own consumption.

Here we used an evolutionary approach to study environmental attitudes based on disease-threat model. We hypothesized that people vulnerable to diseases may ultimately protect themselves by increasing pro-environmental efforts. Indeed, school children who perceived themselves to be vulnerable to diseases had better pro-environmental attitudes than their less disease vulnerable counterparts. Disease sensitive children showed greater beliefs to myths about owls and cuckoos, but myths did not correlate with environmental attitudes. Children from rural areas and girls showed greater environmental concerns than males and children from cities. Only scientistic attitudes toward owls showed correlations with environmental attitudes which suggests that attitudes toward animals show no strong associations with environmental concerns as was implicitly suggested in previous studies. Overall, our study showed that an evolutionary approach can be applied to investigate the nature of inter-personal differences in environmental attitudes in humans. © 2014 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","Animals; Behavioural immune system; Environmental attitudes; Perceived vulnerability to diseases","13058215","","","2-s2.0-84894677971"

Yet despite these service improvements, local authorities still face major challenges in reducing the overall volume of materials collected and the appropriate treatment of an expanding range of materials, including food and garden wastes. Moving 'up' the waste hierarchy towards reduction, re-use and repair raises questions about the ways in which municipal authorities can effectively engage individuals to conceptualise and deal with household materials in ways that move beyond the simple disposal of things, to a re-consideration of 'waste' through new practices of (re)creating value via both habitual and externally-driven behaviours. Utilising an analysis of quantitative survey data from research undertaken in the Royal Borough of Kingston, London, this paper argues that new practices of (re)creating value are underlain by both individualistic and social characteristics, and through the use of a segmentation analysis, the paper presents an example of the ways in which ideas concerning the discrete 'social marketing' of pro-environmental behavioural change can be challenged through unveiling the complexity of waste-related practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Recycling; Segmentation analysis; Waste hierarchy; Waste practices","01436228","","","2-s2.0-84872409385"

This deficit approach presumes that once informed about environmental harms, people will work towards sustainable solutions for healthy societies. Yet research overwhelmingly demonstrates that knowledge of environmental problems is insufficient to spur pro-environmental behaviors. Traditional EE, therefore, has largely been unsuccessful at achieving its goals of engendering environmentally friendly practices and institutions. This article investigates the pedagogical efficacy of a participatory action research (PAR) project for enhancing environmental education in college courses. Qualitative evidence indicates that a PAR project incorporated into an Environmental Sociology course helped students understand how their everyday activities (in particular the consumption of bottled water) exacerbate poor human and environmental health, increased their environmental consciousness, and encouraged them to adopt proenvironmental behaviors and promote sustainability initiatives on campus. Based on these outcomes, the author recommends expanding educational policy to include a description of pedagogical methods such as PAR that successfully operationalize the goals of EE. Policy reforms should encourage educators to incorporate participatory, action-oriented learning opportunities that enable students to apply their knowledge to improve real-world environmental problems.","","14782103","","","2-s2.0-84923851833"

There is a compelling need for policies that do so. To develop them, heritage experts will need to look beyond the kinds of cultural manifestations favoured by tourism and focus instead on ordinary, everyday places. Paying attention to the narratives expressed through peopLe's customs, stories, and memories can give heritage professionals invaluable insights into the psychological bonds that people form with these places and that, with time, come to define their heritage values. Practitioners can adapt research methods from anthropology, sociology, geography, and environment-behaviour studies to analyse people's place-relationships and organise their apparently limitless subjectivity into coherent patterns on which effective public policies can be based. Implementing such policies will depend on certain organisational factors. Responsibility for tangible and intangible heritage must be brought together within the same agencies.

While some ""big-box"" retailers have launched ambitious environmental initiatives, others continue to conduct business as usual. This paper asks: why do some mega-retailers commit to ambitious environmental agendas while others in the same sector do not? And how can the answer to this question improve public policy? I investigate these questions using comparative case studies of four North American big-box retailers: Wal-Mart, Target, Costco and Kroger. My findings suggest that the socialization of senior executives through multi-stakeholder sustainability networks is the critical variable accounting for progressive environmental practices in some corporations and not others. This finding suggests that existing public policies that focus on making the business case for sustainability are based on incomplete assumptions about why companies ""go green."" It further suggests that socialization theory can help explain broader instances of corporate social responsibility and proposes that scholars in this field should devote more attention to the composition of socializing groups.","","13695258","","","2-s2.0-84900815562"

Conserving native vegetation and protecting the Great Barrier Reef respectively, these programmes have used PES as part of a suite of initiatives to achieve improvements in the environmental practices of beef producers. Our analysis reveals that institutional blending and contextual adaptation were crucial in building trust between landholders, farming organisations and those agencies responsible for delivering schemes; enabling the alignment of PES with existing mechanisms of governing, such as regulation and extension; meeting the outcomes required by government funding agencies, often in a short timeframe; improving the targeting of specific land types or landholders; improving the quantity and quality of funding applications; and overcoming fears about perceived threats to private property rights. While these strategies were important in making each PES scheme workable, the use of non-market instruments of regulation and extension compromised the application of neoliberal policy prescriptions to rural environments. However, we argue also that these same instruments contributed to and reinforced the construction of neoliberal landholder subjectivities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Great Barrier Reef; Hybrid governance; Neoliberalisation of nature; Payments for Ecosystem Services; Rural natural resource management","07430167","","JRSTF","2-s2.0-84915737683"

Further, it defines environmental attitude components as moderators and investigates them as predictor of ecological behaviour. The constructs of environmental attitude (EA) and ecological behaviour (EB) are measured using standardized scales with modifications that represent demography of Indian consumers, then, introduced among 300 respondents. Factor analysis, correlations of the factors, and regression analysis are used to draw the results. Constructs of EA and EB are found to be multidimensional and support the literature. Many of their components are found to be significantly correlated inferring that consumers behave ecologically in specific manners depending on the formed attitude. Also, findings suggest that EA components work as predictors of EB. Further, developing a positive environmental attitude is a step to achieve sustainable environment. An attempt is made to improve scales to best suit Indian conditions but development of a reliable and valid measure never ends. This may partly limit the generality of the results. To study fresh issues on Indian conditions, a new scale index can be tested. Researcher, producers, media, policy planners and executives will get a cue to generate relevant value of their work. The paper is a maiden attempt on Indian consumers and has enough potential to change the behaviour for achieving sustainable living. It will strengthen the literature in extrapolating the consumer classes besides identifying two new components of EB: costly exercise and uncaring behaviour. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Components and predictors; Consumer behaviour; Ecological behaviour; Environmental attitude; India","17471117","","","2-s2.0-84874927357"

Social scientists are studying the human dimension of environmental problems. Recently, interest in how everyday behaviors of individuals can cause negative environmental changes and how to encourage individuals to perform environmentally friendly behaviors has increased. The social and psychological determinants of individual environmental behaviors have been widely studied in recent times. The research on environmental behaviors in Pakistan is in its initial phase. The objective of this paper is to discuss the potential role of social sciences in improving the environmental protection by promoting responsible environmental behaviors in Pakistan, and to discuss the need for further researches in future on individual environmental behaviors in Pakistan. Finally attention is drawn to some of the questions that environmental behavior research in Pakistan should address in future studies.","Environmental behavior; Environmental problems; Islam; Pakistan; Social sciences","20392117","","","2-s2.0-84892495415"

Design/methodology/approach: A research framework that draws from the belief-action-outcome (BAO) framework and that consisted of 11 hypotheses was developed. Data were collected from a sample of 322 IT professionals and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results identify the pro-environmental personal computing actions that IT professionals are taking and how their Green IT beliefs, attitudes, information acquisition capability, and organizational fields influence their behavior. Research limitations/implications: The sample was limited to Australian respondents. The measurement of IT-specific environmental practices was not exhaustive nor were the measures of macro- and micro-antecedents of Green IT belief and attitude. Practical implications: National, regional, and international professional associations such as the Association of Information Systems can influence pro-environmental behavior among IT professionals through the creation and dissemination of information that shape both general and IT-specific environmental beliefs. Originality/value: The novelty of this work lies in: first, proposing and testing a research framework that can be leveraged in future studies; second, establishing how organizational fields and availability of information contribute to the formation of IT professionals' environmental beliefs and attitudes; third, applying and suggesting potential extension to the BAO framework to evaluate the association between IT practices and environmental sustainability among IT professionals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Adoption; Behaviour; Empirical study; Green computing/Green IT; Practice; Structural equation modelling","09593845","","","2-s2.0-84902497871"

It is this reverence for the natural world that is believed to drive their environmentalism. This project found ninety percent of the all Pagans surveyed engaged in some environmental behaviors. In looking at the inclusion of environmental issues in their spiritual practices, Wiccans were significantly less likely to state this compared to other contemporary Pagans and Druids. We found that reverence for the Earth and as well as survival of the planet and humanity were significant motivations for environmental behaviors. Additionally, the longer one had been a Pagan as well as the inclusion of environmental issues such as healing the earth and creating a cleaner environment, in their spiritual practices was also significantly correlated with engaging in environmental behaviors. Neither being Druid nor being Wiccan impacted the level of environmental behaviors.

The main research problem was to explore these individuals' present and past life experiences, in the light of their activism, towards the issue of climate change. Narrative inquiry was chosen as a methodology for this research as it gives importance to experience and facilitates the study of an issue in all of its wholeness and complexity. The research involved in-depth interviews with three participants as well as living alongside the participants in an effort to build a relationship with them and to experience being an environmental activist. The participants were members of a local environmental organisation - Friends of the Earth (Malta). The outcomes of this study provide an opportunity for reflection on the factors that affect pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour and their implications on environmental education. This reflection will enable informed efforts to engage more young people in environmental activism. From the narratives produced, it is clear that there is no single factor that is optimal for promoting pro-environmental behaviour and environmental activism.

In other words, precaution was written into toxic water pollutant control law and was beginning to be written into policy and regulations. By 1976, the tables were completely turned. The EPA abandoned the safety-providing approach in the implementation of the law, even though the law required it, and adopted a risk-taking approach in the creation of standards for the vast majority of toxic water pollutants.

Taking cues from scholarship interrogating the production of capitalist natures (e.g., Smith, 1984/2008; Braun, 2000; Heynan et al., 2007). I ask what it means in environmental terms to put risk at the intersection of capital and rule--to conceive of it as something that to paraphrase Dillon (2008, p. 319) makes the combination of capital and rule possible, and to interpret risk as something which (as Martin (2007b, p. 67) has suggested) undertakes to create the very conditions that make new wealth possible. I argue that in order to understand the intersection of capital and rule in environmental terms, risk must be understood as an epistemic framework and political ontology consistent with the advent of capitalist political economy--not as an occasion of danger or geographical condition of insecurity. Using difference as a starting point to attempt to think through connections between risk and accumulation I suggest that risk is a knowledge practice instrumental to accumulation and the politics of rule that secure it, which obscures the functioning of difference and processes of differentiation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accumulation; Difference; Governmentality; Production of nature; Risk; Rule","00167185","","","2-s2.0-84873985599"

This paper demonstrates that opportunity exists to integrate and orientate sustainability practices in developing human capital.

As a response, scholars note that promoting environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) on the part of the citizenry is critical for the growth and development of efficient environmental governance. However, despite the introduction of a variety of measures by governments to encourage greener practices, influencing citizens' behavior remains a major challenge.

Framing influences recognized antecedents of pro-environmental behavior such as attitudes, and traditional educational outcomes such as critical thinking. Yet, because commonly used frames are based in metaphors that tend to portray nature as resource and resist ecological complexities, sustainability educators may be undermining their own goals. This paper makes the case for a promising new construct synthesized from the education and attitude literature, called critical elaboration, and examines the impact of framing on this variable. College student participants read texts portraying humans as either a part of nature (systems metaphor) or apart from nature (non-systems metaphor) in either an active or passive voice, then responded using a thought-listing technique. Frames employing a systems metaphor rather than a non-systems metaphor elicited significantly more critical elaboration, as did frames that employed active voice. Data suggest that education for sustainability requires thoughtful consideration of metaphor underlying message frames. © 2013 AESS.","Critical Thinking; Elaboration; Environmental education; Framing; Sustainability education","21906483","","","2-s2.0-84977079167"
